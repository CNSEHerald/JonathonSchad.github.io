                <p>The CNSE Herald is a student-run electronic news source serving SUNY Polytechnic Institute. Operating out of the desk next to NFE 4423, the Herald covers topics pertaining to student interests ranging from local and world news to the latest updates in science. The electronic publishing platform allows students to gain experience with technical and journalistic writing, photography, and web design while staying current with the demand for online media. </p>

                <p>The CNSE Music Club welcomes all students interested in performing, arranging, or directing music. Style-based sub-groups are formed each semester based on interest and availability. Students from the music club have performed at graduation, the holiday party, and at a CNSE-hosted open-mic talent show.</p>

                <h4>Mikhail Yermakov, myermakov@sunypoly.edu</h4>
                <p>NanoElectronics Club (NEC) is a newly established student organization at CNSE. Our primary objective is the academic success of the members, particularly in the courses related to Electrical Engineering, Electronics and VLSI. Our key ideas are relevance to the coursework and student support. We prioritize a mathematical approach to engineering and bottom-up design ”from scratch” rather than modular assembly: foundation comes first, innovation follows. We work to develop a thorough theoretical basis which goes along with the material taught at CNSE and enhances students’ experience by means of study groups and tutoring sessions, as well as hands-on projects.</p>

                <p>The CNSE Art Club allows students to break away from the science and math that CNSE is notorious for, and gives them a chance to do something very different--art.  The club allows members to dabble in many forms of painting, drawing, and (hopefully soon) sculpture once or twice a week during group meetings.  It is my hope that the art club will be able to participate in local art events and travel to museums in the future.</p>

                <p>- Every Saturday during the school year, we plan outdoor excursions to explore Upstate NY. These excursions include but are not limited to Hiking, Skiing, Whitewater Rafting, Camping, and like activities. Throughout the Fall 2015 semester, we reached the summit of 25 mountains (mostly in the Adirondacks). For the Spring 2016 semester, we look forward to continuing our trek's, gaining experience with winter hiking, as well as throwing some Skiing and Whitewater Rafting into the mix. </p>

The experienced and the inexperienced are all welcome to participate in our regular trips to The Edge in Halfmoon. The inexperienced will learn all they need to know, with practice, to safely climb, and the experienced will be able to quickly jump into a casual, satisfying climbing environment. We, as a club, aspire to take outdoor climbing trips to expand on this already delightful and rewarding activity.</p>

                <h4>Nick Pieniazek, npieniazek@albany.edu</h4>
                <p>The purpose of the American Vacuum Society CNSE Chapter is threefold. The first being to give students as much exposure to the professional environment in a variety of ways which includes but is not limited to career fairs, resume critiquing sessions, internship application walk throughs and networking advisement. Our second mission goal is to encourage critical thinking development skills. Critical thinking skills are not something someone is simply born with. It is a skill that is practice honed and never perfected. AVS aims to test and develop these skills by encouraging students to engage in activities such as Philosophy Night. Our final mission statement and quite possibly our most beloved is to just relax, have fun and take some time to recoup the mind. Highly intense schools such as CNSE can often take the pizzazz out of life and we at AVS try to maximize comradery by letting students have fun in group activities like bridge building competitions, open mic nights and trivia contests. When these objectives are combined it makes for a club that provides both long term professional development as well as lifelong critical thinking skills that will only enrich the lives of AVS participants.</p>

                <p>UAV Club brings students together interested in designing, building and flying drones. Students are free to suggest ideas they would like to try regarding drones or projects. Members who are interested in learning how to fly are able to do so by flying already built planes. We have participated in the global space balloon challenge and received funding from SUNY Polytechnic Institute to do so. In addition, members have gotten together to create a quad-copter obstacle course for first-person view quad-copters. We also attend aerospace museums whenever we have the chance to do so as well as participate in outreach events to teach younger students about drones.</p>

Since its founding in 1922, more than 200,000 persons have been accepted into lifetime membership, and more than 670 chapters have been established throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. As an interest club, we are looking for second semester sophomores or older to join us in starting the honor society. Must be on the track for a biological science concentration or major.</p>

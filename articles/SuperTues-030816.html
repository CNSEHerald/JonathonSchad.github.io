                <p class="lead">On March 1st, eleven states held primaries in the event dubbed "Super Tuesday" during which 595 delegates were up for grabs. Most delegates fell into the hands of party frontrunners: Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump and Democratic Presidential Candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, each having won seven states. Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Ted Cruz came in second for their parties, garnering the votes of three and four states, respectively.  But it's not just about the states-it's about the delegates.</p>		<p>The number of delegates each state receives is based primarily on population.  On the Republican side, some states award their delegates in proportion with the popular vote in the state's primary or caucus, while in others it is a winner-takes-all affair.  For the Democrats, all states have a proportional system of some kind.</p>		<p>Trump's victories in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Vermont, and Virginia added 256 delegates to his tally for a total of 382. Trump still has a long way to go to obtain the 1237 needed to clinch the Republican nomination. Cruz remains not far behind, with a total of 300 after taking Alaska, Oklahoma, and the largest Super Tuesday state, Texas.  Senator Marco Rubio took Minnesota, earning 101 delegates for a total of 128.</p>		<p>Clinton won 486 votes from Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia.  This brings her total to 1121, almost half of the 2383 needed to secure the Democratic Presidential nomination.  Sanders, the only other serious democratic contender, trails behind with a total of 484. </p>		<p>Trump's lead is not as decisive as it once was.  Currently, a unification of Cruz's and Rubio's delegates would be more than enough to overtake his lead.  However, as Cruz and Rubio continue to split the more traditional Republican vote, Trump is likely to gain more votes in the more moderate and northern states.  If the trends displayed on Super Tuesday continue, Trump may indeed obtain the most delegates of the Republican nominees. </p>		<p>Even so, it is still possible that no candidate collects the necessary 1237 delegate votes to win. In this case, the nominee will be decided by a second vote at the GOP convention, held in July, during which the delegates are free to choose whom they please.  This instance of a "brokered convention" (one in which the nominee remained unknown after the first round of balloting) has not occurred since 1948. </p>		<p>On the Democratic side, Clinton's lead continues to grow.  But thanks to the proportionality system present in Democratic primaries, Sanders still has a chance to keep Clinton from obtaining the elusive 2383 necessary delegates.  It is also worth noting that Western Illinois University, which has accurately predicted every presidential election since 1975, previously named Sanders as the President-to-be. </p>		<p>Trump and Clinton remain in the lead after the events of Super Tuesday.  However, many primaries remain before the nominees are ultimately decided, and much can change before the conventions this summer. </p>

                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p class="lead">Despite having had different motives and varying expectations, once we finished tunneling our way through high school, we found ourselves here. Amusingly, despite administrative hurdles and lagging student space development, it appears that we CNSE freshmen continue to find ourselves here. This must undeniably mean that CNSE either has some irresistible, and also inexplicable, charisma, or its opportunities truly do outweigh its apparent downfalls. No matter the how, the why, or even the what, once you're here, everyone agrees that it certainly takes a particular amalgamation of strategies and grit to persevere. Gathered below are some of the haphazard, scattered things we've tried to tell ourselves in order to make the most of our opportunities and our challenges. Only time will tell what worked and what didn't, but what's definitely true is once you're here, you need to decide for yourself how to keep believing and stay motivated. </p>
		<p>Probably most essential is acknowledging that time is important. Whether it's real or an illusion or whatever suits your fancy, use it wisely, because as far as we know it keeps passing by despite even our most earnest grievances and pleas. Don't spend any time doing something which you are not enjoying, from which you are not benefiting, or into which you are not putting enough effort to make excellent. Try this even with homework and projects. Never complain of being bored - as long as you remain in possession of your mind, boredom is impossible. You cannot "be" bored, you can only, as the French say, "bore yourself." So if you're feeling bored, it's your fault. Do something about it. Do something productive, something about which you're passionate, or something that will help the world in some small way. And think of the future, but live in the moment. We don't mean "YOLO," we mean really try to experience the sanctity and wonder of every moment, because there will never be another like it, and acknowledge, experiment with your existence. Marvel at our presence here on this gorgeous spinning marble in some sparkly celestial soup. </p>
 		<p>Also, forget about "being" yourself. Determine who you want to be, and then focus on creating yourself, on making yourself into the best possible embodiment of all your values. Respect everybody and every living thing, because every life is remarkably beautiful and precious, and you can never know another human being's entity or struggles or life; that would require you to be them rather than yourself, a paradox which would defy logic and most likely induce some degree of awkwardness. However, you do not need to respect everyone's character or personality, or what you have been shown of it. Respect of individual character must be earned, so respect what is honorable and honest and worth respecting. You don't need to like everybody, and not everybody will like you. That's ok. It's no cause for tension; peace can exist perfectly well in such a state. Don't worry. Worrying has yet to help anybody, especially when desperately trying to finish lab reports at 1 AM. </p>

		<p>Set goals and work towards them. Otherwise, don't even bother setting them. Work hard, because if you know why you're working and you agree with it, it's not a chore. Watch the clouds and how they drift across the sky. Ask why. Make yourself happy, because no one else can do it for you. CNSE may be many things, but primarily it is what you make of it. </p>

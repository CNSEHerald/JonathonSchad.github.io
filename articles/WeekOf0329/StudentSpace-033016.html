                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">Thursday, March 31st will mark the grand opening of the long awaited student lounge at CNSE.  The space will be located on the third floor of NFS and provides a dedicated space for students to work, study, collaborate, and relax.  The lounge will occupy what was formally Commerce Hub and will span a good portion of the third floor. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The UGSA executive board worked closely with administration as well as interior designer Kerry Turnell in order to create a space that would adequately and effectively serve student necessities.  Jeff Richards, UGSA vice-president, and Christopher Kendra, UGSA treasurer, are both members of this small working group, which was put together to voice the concerns and needs of the students in regards to the planning of the lounge.  </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">“We polled the student body and weeded out what we thought were the most important aspects of what we wanted in [the lounge], and we used that as our model to start,” Kendra said.  “We had input from the very beginning, so we kind of had the foundation of what the design would be.”  Turnell, who designs most of CNSE, then took these suggestions and ideas to design a working student space revolving around them.  “She’s very good. She designs most of CNSE and definitely knows what she is doing, as she does it well,” Kendra said in regards to working with Turnell. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The initial space that will open on Thursday will not necessarily represent the finished product.  It will become shaped by the students the more they use it.  “When it opens up, it’ll be a very rudimentary space, and as we use it more, we will start filling it up with more furniture, supplies, and whatnot as we see what fits and what doesn’t work”, Kendra said. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The student lounge will also house divided spaces for undergraduate students as well as graduate students.  The undergraduate students will have occupancy of one side of the third floor, while the other side will be for the graduate students.  Each side will need to be accessed through the issued CNSE ID badges, much like the cloud room.  Both undergraduate and graduate students will have access to each other’s respective rooms. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Going down the road, there are plans to accommodate space for club meeting spaces and general meeting areas.  There will also be an area dedicated to the UGSA to hold meetings and office hours for students to voice their concerns directly without having to attend the UGSA’s biweekly meetings.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The thought for establishing a dedicated student space began when the idea was mentioned in March of 2015 during a meeting.  Originally, the plan was to have the student lounge finished and ready for occupancy in the Fall of 2015, but with the recent move to ZEN, the follow-through of these plans became delayed.  The plans for a student space had been effectively in motion for a year, but the execution of said plans was not initiated until last month. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">There had also initially been plans for a temporary student space in CESTM during the interim of construction, but none of those plans ever came to fruition.  “It was a nightmare of trying to push the issue farther than it should have been pushed. Even if we didn’t have a permanent space, there should have been a temporary space available,” Richards said.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The necessity of such a lounge space has been on the minds of many students who have been looking for an appropriate place to relax and study amongst the mainly “business-professional” atmosphere on the CNSE site.  “This is often given the impression of an office space, but it should be students first.  We are the Colleges of Nanoscale Science and Engineering, not the facility for nanoscale research,” Kendra remarked, “But it’s done now, and they have come forward with the goods eventually. They have done a great job, so I am not too put off at all.”</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Even though finalization of the student lounge has been a long time coming, first impression of the space are largely positive.  “At the end of the day, it got done.  Personally, I think it looks great at the moment.  They did a great job,” Richards said.  The interior design of the student space will take on the same aesthetic as the rest of CNSE, keeping with the modern theme and atmosphere of the complex.  “I’m happy.  It looks modern and like it fits with the theme of the building.  There is space for students to relax, talk, but also space for students to work, and that is what we were going for.  It’s got to be a place for all students to go.  It’ll be good.  I’m excited,” remarked Kendra.</p>

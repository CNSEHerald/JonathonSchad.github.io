                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">There’s that common argument that history has a tendency to repeat itself.  And we learn history to prevent that from happening, right?  A law recently passed by the Kuwaiti government says otherwise.  Mankind has not learned from its mistakes. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Kuwait recently enacted a law that mandates citizens must register their DNA with the government.  The government will subsidize the DNA testing and management of their new government database.  DNA-profiles of around 1.3 million citizens and 2.9 million foreign residents will be stored within this database.  Anyone who does not comply will receive a lovely $33,000 fine and possible jail time. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">What could drive Kuwait to such a drastic mandate?  The local government claims that this stemmed from a suicide bombing in Kuwait City last June. The bombing, orchestrated by the Islamic State, resulted in the death of 26 people and wounded at least 227 more people. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The Kuwaiti government hopes that DNA-profiling will help deter criminal acts and expedite arrests and investigations in the future.  A noble cause to be sure but is that really all there is to it?</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The initial enactment of the mandate may have no immediate consequences, but the future cannot make such promises. Take a look at the history of the eugenics movement, a movement that mankind should be ashamed of but it happened all the same. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The idea of racial superiority has been around for as long as mankind has walked the Earth, but Francis Galton gave it a name in 1883.  He called it ‘eugenics.’ Eugenics refers to the idea that desirable traits are hereditary and that humanity could selectively breed for these traits.  Herbert Spencer put out a similar idea around 1860 that popularly became known as ‘Social Darwinism.’  Believe it or not, Charles Darwin was very much against the idea of ‘survival of the fittest’ and eugenics.  But he is often credited with the popularizing of this movement because he published his work <i>On the Origin of Species</i>.  Poor guy.  </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">In the late 19th century and most of the 20th century, eugenics became a popular pseudo-science.  The state government of Virginia even enacted the first forced sterilization law, the Racial Integrity Act in 1924.  Imperial nations predominately used the notion of eugenics as a justification for colonizing parts of Asia and Africa. And even if we ignore the incredibly negative impact colonization had on the development of civilizations in Africa, there are some horrific events that took place in the name of eugenics. For example, genocide. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Genocide has bloodied the history of virtually every nation in the modern world. The elimination of the indigenous people, such as the United State’s treatment of the Native Americans, is an oft-cited example of genocide justified by racial superiority.  But that happened a long time ago, so it doesn’t apply to the modern world. Right? </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Wrong.  Modern history has been plagued by death at the hand of the eugenics movement.  The Holocaust is obviously the most easily recognizable one, resulting in the death of around 11 million people.  But there was the Rape of Nanking and occupation of Manchuria by the Japanese, the elimination of the Hutus by the Tutsis in Rwanda, the attempt to create a mythic race in Cambodia, the targeting of the native Mayan population in Guatemala, and the targeting of Muslim Bosniaks and Croats by the Bosnian Serbs.  All of these committed in the name of ethnic cleansing deeply seated in the notion of eugenics. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">You can see how mandatory DNA-profiling could be a problem.  I can acknowledge that there may be benefits to the mandate.  Not only in regards to the safety of the Kuwaiti people, but also the medical benefits it could pose.  But it’s a slippery slope that could return society to the dark days of the popularized eugenics movement. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">People who carry the genes for some mental disorder or latent disease could be forcefully sterilized to prevent them from reproducing.  At worst, these people could be killed in the name of eugenics.  Perhaps the government finds, or claims to have found, a ‘genetic link’ between people who carry out violent crimes.  They could then claim to stop crime before it happens by eliminating people with this ‘genetic link.’</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Of course that last one would only be possible in fantastical dystopian fictions, but it makes one stop and think. Is it really that impossible?  </p>

                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">This election season, political candidates have explored a wide range of techniques to get their points across, and a great deal about their effectiveness in office can be revealed by the utilization of these various methods that they employ on their political websites.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The main issue in this election concerning official information released by candidates is the fact that some people in the presidential race aren’t releasing any real information at all.  When researching political candidates’ stances on the issues for “The 2016 Election Cheat Sheet”, I began my investigation of political candidates with Donald Trump.  Like every other candidate’s website, it has an ‘Issues’ page where he expresses his official feeling and plans for his presidency.  Unlike every other candidate’s website, it struck me as strangely devoid of information.  The page contains nineteen YouTube videos of Trump discussing his feeling on the major issues of this election, which I first thought was very modern and progressive, but these videos average a run time of 45 seconds each.  What is considered the most important issue of the 2016 election, the economy, is discussed by Trump in a 26 second video.  In the span of 26 seconds he says only two sentences on the subject, including this incomplete and grammatically incorrect sentence, “one of the things I’m ganna do, and largely with our great tax plan, where everybody’s taxes is going down, we’re going to grow our economy.”  Altogether, on his official website, Trump gives minimal information on his goals and how he plans to accomplish them, and he is not the only candidate doing this.  Like Trump’s website, Ted Cruz’s current website gives relatively little information on his policies; his economy discussion contains only six sentences.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">On the opposite end of the organizational and informational spectrum, the official website of Bernie Sanders contains the most information on his views on the economy of any candidate.  He breaks this topic down into five different discussions, which pertain to various aspects of the United States economy.  In just one of these discussions, that on “Income and Wealth Inequality”, he includes two line graphs, a bar graph and a pie chart, that summarize income, wealth, and poverty in the United States.  The page goes on to detail how Bernie Sanders feels about the problems these graphs illustrate, followed by a thirteen point breakdown of his plans to fix these issues, and finally an 8 minute and 37 second YouTube video of even more graphs, statistics, plans, and ideas.  </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Lack of information is not the only concerning characteristic of campaign websites.  As in most elections, petty mudslinging and passive-aggressive attacks on other candidates can be found on both the Republican and Democratic sides.  To get to Marco Rubio’s ‘Issues’ page, I had to pass through a home page where I was immediately surprised by the number of attack ads posted; over a fourth of the stories and links on his home page are promoting opposition to the Democratic and Republican front-runners, Clinton and Trump, respectively, but primarily Trump.  One link reads, “Stop Donald Trump: Donate Now”.  Hillary Clinton has a similar issues discussion structure compared to Rubio’s website, and also like Rubio, runs anti-Trump ads on her home page.  When trying to enter Clinton’s website, you are asked to agree to statements such as “bigotry and bluster are not foreign policy credentials” and previously ones that call out Trump by name.  Her shop even sells stickers with the passive-aggressive quote, “Love Trumps Hate”.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">There is certainly a wide range of openness and effort from candidates to convey their opinions and plans for their presidency.  The ability to run a successful political website does not necessarily imply the ability to run a country, but the degree to which candidates make their goals known may say something about how “for the people” they may be.  How they conduct themselves in their own web domain may say something about who they really are.  I would highly recommend checking out these websites, as the insights they gave me were truly comical and eye-opening.</p>

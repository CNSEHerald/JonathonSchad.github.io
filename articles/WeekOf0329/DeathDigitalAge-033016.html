                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">In my sophomore year of college, my friend Caitlin passed away. It was sudden, ugly, and tragic. Those who have lost people too young can understand the emotions.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">When I went back home for the wake and funeral, my friends and I discussed the elephant in the room —Caitlin’s blog was still active. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Like many other social media sites, on Tumblr you can set your posts to queue, or to post at certain times.  Though it may sound like the plot of a cheap B horror movie, to us it was equal parts pain and comfort. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The age of communication has caused gaps in many aspects of our society.  Unlike the millennia that came before, the Internet has forced mourning to become an inherently public and personal act.  Moreover, the connectivity of the 21st century has caused changes in the way we look at grief and mourning through communication by social media and applied technologies.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Not limited to Tumblr, posting from a deceased’s avatar is an experience that even my parents could relate to.  Facebook is quickly becoming an internet graveyard.  If Facebook was to stop growing, the number of deceased users would surpass living users by 2065; if Facebook continues on its prospective path, that crossover point is in 2130. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">A person, or immediate family member, can set Facebook to do one of three things after the user’s death: deletion, memorialization, or nothing.  In a memorialized account, Facebook users are aware that the account owner is deceased.  The term ‘Remembering’ will be shown next to the person’s name, no one can log onto the account to change information, and the profile will stop appearing in public spaces.  In many ways, a memorialized Facebook account is a digital archive of a person’s life. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">In the case where a friend or family member chooses to keep the Facebook account active, these accounts look no different from a survivor’s account.  The birthday of the deceased would still show in notifications and a person could still receive ‘suggested for you’ friend requests.  </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">This type of increased communication has changed the way individuals look at bereavement.  In the past the relationship between the living and the dead has been static.  Now, ongoing updates by mourners who exist within a community of peers have changed that relationship.  This practice is seen, largely, among adolescent groups and is believed to be a way to maintain a relationship with the deceased.  Studies have shown mixed sentiment towards the effect that long term community engagement has on death acceptance. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The key area of contention lies in persistence.  Unlike an obituary, a Facebook page can be constantly active depending on the administrator.  These pages create an environment where all types of people can interact.  If an individual posts something another mourner finds offensive, this can lead to conflict.  For example, if a young woman posts a photo of her and her friend sharing a beer, the deceased’s elderly grandmother might be offended.  What is deemed respectful in some settings is inappropriate in others; this is known as context collapse.  Drs. Marwick and Ellison summarized their findings of a 2012 study by stating: </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">“This publicness, together with the technical mechanisms of Facebook, affects public displays of grief and portrayals of the deceased.  The visibility of social media allows acquaintances and far-away friends to pay respects, and makes possible explicit displays indicating the deceased’s significance, which may bring comfort to mourners.  Simultaneously, this visibility engenders context collapse and larger audiences that may include unwelcome participants such as trolls.”</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">In its most incendiary form, one can see context collapse culminate in the much reviled ‘Funeral Selfie’ trend that grabbed the attention of news networks in 2013.  As its name suggests, a funeral selfie refers to a photo taken at a wake or a funeral.  Captions of these photos typically state sentiments like, “Cried off all my makeup, but funeral”.  Today, the practice is still hotly contented with many claiming that it is entirely inappropriate.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">However, some professionals advocate for these photos believing them to be a natural part of the grieving process.  Caitlin Doughty, mortician and founder of the Order of the Good Death, warned others about being overly critical in an interview with OZY, “There are many different ways that cultures deal with death, many different ways they express themselves through ritual actions.  Teenagers taking selfies is a ritual action, just as valid as any other ritual action performed at the time of death.”</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Thankfully, the amalgam of ideas created by mass communication is not without benefits.  The internet is increasing our ability to communicate effectively, or in the least, quickly.  Today, grief applications are gaining in popularity as a way to express oneself after the loss of a loved one.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Connectivity based apps are currently being used to promote healthy conversation among mourners.  TalkLife is a peer-to-peer support network which helps users move through difficult periods.  Relying on an open forum can come with the obvious positives and negatives associated with the internet.  As the app can be as private or public as the user desires, issues have arisen regarding cyberbullying.  One of the more progressive aspects to TalkLife is their collaboration with Microsoft, MIT and Harvard University. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Through the use of probabilistic and decision theoretic models, steps are being taken to better understand, intervene, and predict users who are likely to self-harm.  The research is being collected from a subset of users who elected to participate in the study.  TalkLife intervention is expected to launch soon and would be the first platform to use machine learning to give professionals the ability to talk to specific self-injury prone users. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">There are other apps in development that take a more personal look at what it means to grieve.  Flutter, an experimental app concept, is designed to help adolescents cope with loss.  This app relies on music to create an expressive ritual that aids in constructing reflection of the emotional states one experiences through the grieving process.  By allowing the user to control tone, pitch, and rhythm, Flutter provides a platform for young mourners to externalize and connect with grief. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">As the world changes with technology, it should be no surprise that the process of grieving moves along in tandem.  Social media and assistive technology has grown in both popularity and in the importance it has in daily life.  This is not inherently bad.  Greif is a personal journey.  For some, that means snapping selfies on the way to a funeral, and for others, it is expression through music.  Today’s issues of context collapse and cyberbullying could be the growing pains of a culture trying its best to remain connected in humanity’s darkest times. </p>

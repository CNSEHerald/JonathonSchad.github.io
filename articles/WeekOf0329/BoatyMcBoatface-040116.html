                	<hr>

                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">The National Environmental Research Council turned to the Internet for suggestions on a name for the UK’s new polar research vessel.  The Internet cast their votes, giving the ‘RSS Boaty McBoatface’ a commanding lead over the rest of the competition. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">This new vessel, costing £200 million (~$376 million), will replace the UK’s existing polar fleet – the RRS James Clark Ross and RRS Ernest Shackleton – and is expected to become operational in 2019.  The ship has been designed to operate in both the Artic and the Antarctic, boasting greater endurance and ice-breaking capabilities than its predecessors.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">In honor of the UK’s newest ship, the National Environmental Research Council (NERC) set up an online poll for users to vote and suggest names for the vessel.  In an initial press release, NERC’s chief executive, Duncan Wingham, explained the launching of this naming campaign.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">“Today we are launching our campaign to bring our ship to the UK people, asking for their help to find her a name that encapsulates her role at the forefront of UK science.  We are excited to hear what the public has to suggest and we really are open to ideas.” </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Shackleton, Endeavour, and Falcon were monikers the NERC suggested before opening it up to the public on March 17 to let them weigh in on what they think this state-of-the-art research vessel should be called.  In their initial press release, the NERC stated that they were “looking for an inspirational name that exemplifies the work [the ship] will do. The ship could be named after a local historical figure, movement, or landmark – or a famous polar explorer or scientist.” </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Soon after, the Internet settled on the name ‘Boaty McBoatface.’ </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The mastermind behind the name, former BBC radio host, James Hand, explained on BBC Radio Jersey his inspiration for the name. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">“I read the list of entries and there were about 3,000 at the time. Some of them were really, really funny.  Clifford the Big Red Boat was my favorite.  So I thought I’d throw one into the ring to see what happens.  It got a few likes and I thought nothing of it.” </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Hand has since apologized to the NERC for his joke running amok.  He told BBC Radio, “it was my suggestion but the storm that has been created; it’s got legs of its own.”  This storm resulted in the polling website crashing due to the influx of traffic. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The NERC is, in no way, the first ask social media for naming suggestions.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">In 2007, Greenpeace tagged a pod of humpback whales migrating to the South Pacific. The nonprofit held a competition to name one of the whales to keep the pod safe from poachers.  While Aurora, Libertad, and Aiko were finalists, ‘Mister Splashy Pants’ won with 78 percent of the vote in the end. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">A 2012 concert giveaway circulated on Facebook promising that the school that received the most likes would win a concert by Taylor Swift.  Members of Reddit and 4Chan banded together to make the Horace Mann School for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing the winners. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">In 2012, Mountain Dew asked their Internet followers to name their new green apple-flavored drink.  Their “Dub the Dew” promotion was short-lived.  Mountain Dew closed the polls when 4Chan message boards brought the suggestion “Hitler did nothing wrong” to the top of the poll. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Despite the Internet’s backing of yet another ridiculous name, Alison Robinson, a spokeswoman, said in an email that the group was “delighted by the enthusiasm and creativity.”  In the end, the research council will have final say on what the vessel will be called, but the poll has generated interest in the UK’s newest project. </p>

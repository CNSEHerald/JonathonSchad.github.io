                <p>Dear Community Theatres, </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">I get it. <i>Hamilton</i> is the hottest musical since Rent opened in the 90’s. Suddenly, college aged students are clamoring to learn more about the founding of America while simultaneously caring about the social issues of our age. The Musical Hamilton premiered in early February of 2015, though Hamilton-Mania started with Lin-Manuel Miranda’s White House performance in 2009. Today, the rights to <i>Hamilton</i> haven’t been, and won’t be, released and there is no way to capitalize on the need for an antebellum brand of alternative musical. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">But wait! A show has been brought to your attention, one that bills itself as “An exhilarating and raucous look at one of our nation's founding rock stars, reinventing the life of our seventh president”. At first glance this may sound perfect, but do not be fooled. <i>Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson</i> fails in every respect that <i>Hamilton</i> succeeds. Its poor command of satire, feeble attempts at social discourse, and uninspired music weakens not only the continuity of its plot, but undermines the messages of inclusivity that it attempts to attain. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">When I saw the University at Albany production of <i>Bloody Bloody</i> I was shocked with what I found. The sets were beautiful, the lighting was striking, and the Talent was talented. What was lacking, or in this case completely bereft, was the quality of the show they were performing.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The show opened with a disclaimer about how <i>Bloody Bloody</i> aimed to insult people from all walks of life in order to bring to light prominent issues of both our time and in the Era of Good Feelings. They did not make good on their promise; races were mentioned and then completely ignored for the duration of the show. Though there is a larger issue at hand. Satire should not need to be announced if done correctly. The content of the work should allow the audience to draw their own conclusions.  In the spirit of <i>Bloody Bloody</i>, I will add a disclaimer of my own. “In no way does this opinion editorial seek to undermine the talent or production team of a particular show. Instead, this article is meant to elucidate issues within the writing and overall vision of <i>Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson</i>. Please enjoy.”</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">If I am allowed a metaphor; satire is the sniper rifle of comedy. It seeks to poke holes in an institution with amazing accuracy. Examples of excellent satire can be found everywhere: <i>South Park</i>’s latest season examining the complex concepts of gentrification and social justice, and John Oliver’s takedown of for profit churches by creating ‘Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption’. <i>Bloody Bloody</i> on the other hand is more aptly compared to a shotgun. The jokes often completely miss their mark, and when they hit it is usually due more to the actors’ prowess then genuine hilarity. Frequent fourth-wall-breaks completely eliminated suspension of disbelief and one-liners rooted in stereotypes undermined the message that the show was trying to send. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Another point of tension is how the musical handled still-relevant racial issues. Where Hamilton uses color-blind casting and dialogue to open a narrative, <i>Bloody Bloody</i> uses cheap gags which promote a rather convoluted and contradictory message. One instance of confusion was after the death of Andrew Jacksons’ parents. Actors intentionally dressed in Halloween-costume-quality Native American Wardrobe entered and shot members of the Jackson family to establish his motivation for hating indigenous people. Though the use of cheap costuming may have been an attempt to distance this action from actual Native Peoples, the message became even more unclear when the actors square danced to ‘Indian Outlaw’ by Tim McGraw to exit stage. Though these may have been artistic decision made by the University at Albany Theatre Department, the whole show was marred by this type of confused writing. Though the University at Albany Theatre Department made every attempt to contextualize the actions of Andrew Jackson and America at large through the inclusion of images of the #BlackLivesMatter movement, Anti-Japanese Internment, Labor Rights and Women’s Reproductive Rights in the production, it did little to fix the racists undertones present in the actual writing of the show. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">When <i>Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson</i> opened on Broadway it was met with fairly mixed reviews. Some viewed it as being ‘provocative’ and ‘entertaining’ while others, like the Native American Theatre Initiative, saw it as a complete failure. In an interview with The Capital, the show’s artistic director, Oskar Eustis, admitted, “…although I may completely believe the point that this production is making, that it is ultimately pro-native, there are an awful lot of ways in which it may not be perceived that way”. The show’s troubles did not end after its short tenure on Broadway. <i>Bloody Bloody</i> is consistently picketed when performed on college campuses. A production at Stanford University was shut down in 2014 due to student outcry and another production in Raleigh was cancelled in 2015.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Lastly, I must address the issue of general entertainment value. If un-funny, possibly racist, musicals are still your thing (see Golden Age of Broadway) the musical writings of Michael Freidman in <i>Bloody Bloody</i> are not even in the same league as Lin-Manual Miranda in <i>Hamilton</i>. Miranda mixes complex rhythms to create a hip hop musical with a distinct Broadway style. In contrast, <i>Bloody Bloody</i> advertises itself as ‘emo-rock’ yet is completely barren of any punk influences asides from the occasional amp distortion. The set list consists of repetitive, uninspired lyrics which are underscored by a simplistic four chord scheme. Though I had the pleasure of listening to an extremely talented pit orchestra during the show, there was little they could do to save the audience from the monotony aside from going off book. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">In addition to lack luster musical numbers, the mix of poor comedic choices and racial overtones make <i>Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson</i> a horrendous replacement for <i>Hamilton</i>. In essence, I believe that <i>Bloody Bloody</i>'s fatal flaw was laziness. This was apparent by the seemingly un-vetted comedy, the original producers ignoring the Native American community, and thinking that ‘emo-rock’ just means a whiney white man singing with a grungy guitar. Unfortunately, theatre has a bad reputation for being disconnected to the interest of the general public in favor of the preferences of the rich. This is a reputation Hamilton is trying to change. <i>Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson</i> only serves to show how out of step some members of the theatre community are with the social climate and the American youth. I urge theatres to think twice about the shows they produce and the message that it sends to the community.</p>

        <!-- Post Content -->
        <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">In August 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of flibanserin as a drug treatment for women who experience low libido, otherwise known as hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD).  It is marketed as the first pill targeted to aid the female sex drive.  Recent studies, however, have reported an increase of about only one half of one sexual encounter per month for women who have taken the drug during clinical trials.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">Flibanserin was originally developed as an antidepressant by German pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim and was later repurposed to treat HSDD.  Development was suspended back in 2010 when negative evaluations were given by the FDA, having given the drug two rejections.  Flibanserin finally achieved approval after its rights were transferred to Sprout Pharmaceuticals (now owned by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International) and is currently marketed under the trade name Addyi.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">Addyi received mixed reviews during its clinical trials as it exhibited varying degrees of effectiveness in different women.  Some women reported significant increase in sex drive while others observed no noticeable changes. The initial three clinical trials submitted to the FDA for approval in August showed an average of one additional satisfying sexual encounter per month.  This was adequate enough to justify approval. During a more recent study published in JAMA International Medicine on February 29th, researchers analyzed the results of 5,900 women who took part in these trials.  They concluded that Addyi had resulted in "one-half of an additional sexually satisfying encounter per month".  What "one-half" of a sexual encounter meant, however, was never discussed or defined.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">Many experts say these results are not meaningful and do not justify the side effects that come from Addyi, such as sleepiness, dizziness, nausea, and fatigue.  Most side effects were found to be magnified with the use and consumption of alcohol in some individuals.  Due to these side effects plus the varying degrees of effectiveness in different women, a screening process and prescription are required before being able to acquire the drug.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">Although many people refer to Addyi as the "female Viagra," Addyi utilizes a different mechanism and pathway for treatment.  For men, Viagra treats a physical hindrance of not being able to maintain an erection and only needs to be taken before sex.  Addyi, on the other hand, targets chemicals in the brain in order to stimulate and increase female libido levels while treating chemical and hormonal imbalances.  Women taking Addyi must also take it every night in order to see results, regardless of sexual activity.  Addyi is meant for women with exceptionally low sex drives and is not intended to be used as an aphrodisiac to raise libido above normal.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">According to analyst David Maris at Wells Fargo Securities, it was reported that Addyi was only producing 240 to 290 prescriptions per week in early January of this year.  An estimated $11 million of total yearly sales was calculated for 2016, which falls well below the $150 million projected by Valeant Pharmaceuticals. </p>

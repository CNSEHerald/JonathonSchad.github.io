                <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">The Zika virus is an infectious virus that is known to be transmitted by mosquitoes, specifically the species <i>Aedes aegypti</i>, and is also believed to be sexually transmissible.  It has mostly been considered a tropical disease, like dengue. Due to global warming, its area of influence is spreading to higher latitudes, making millions of people at risk. Researchers from the Institute of Emerging Diseases at Polynesia have discovered a link between Zika and another poorly understood disease, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome.</p>  
		<p style="text-align:justify">Information about the virus is relatively unknown, as there were few major outbreaks in the West before November 2015.  What is known is that the virus targets certain types of neuronal stem cells.  Pregnant women who become infected with the disease have a much higher risk of giving birth to a child with a condition known as microcephaly.  Symptoms of Zika include fever, rashes, red eyes, and possible chance of death associated with infections.  These symptoms tend to last for only a few days up to a week; overall, it is considered a mild infection.  Eighty percent of those infected never show symptoms of the disease.  Although rare, extreme muscle fatigue and weakness for much longer amounts of time have been reported.  Furthermore, the virus' incubation period, while is still unknown, is believed to be of a few days long.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">Recently, Researchers from the Institute of Emerging Diseases at Polynesia discovered a link between Zika and Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, or GBS. GBS is a disease in which the body's immune system attacks nerve cells.  This causes muscle spasms, weakness, and difficulty breathing and has an associated mortality rate of approximately 5%.  In the most extreme cases, paralyzation may occur or the use of breathing tubes may be required.  Symptoms may last from a few weeks to six months, with the majority of patients making a full recovery.  Some, however, do experience permanent damage.  The normal incidence of GBS is typically 1 to 2 in 100,000.  However, the exact cause is still unknown.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">After tracing the spread of the Zika virus through various islands in the Pacific Ocean, researchers have also found an increase in cases of GBS much higher than normal.  While it is known that infections may trigger GBS, the study proves <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(16)00562-6.pdf">a direct correlation between the Zika virus and GBS</a> as all individuals diagnosed with GBS also tested positive for Zika.  Since Zika currently does not have a vaccine or health treatment, according the World Health Organization (WHO), it is advised that traveling to tropical areas be avoided if possible. If travel to such areas is necessary, care should be taken to avoid mosquitoes by using repellant if outside and a bug net when sleeping.  Due to the rapid spread of Zika through the Americas, it is also advised that all at-risk nations prepare an adequate capacity of intensive care beds in case of outbreaks.  Other areas have already enacted measures including warnings to women to avoid becoming pregnant in countries, such as Brazil, where abortions and contraceptives are difficult to obtain.  In the US, many Republicans are reconsidering their antiabortion stance as Zika scares have been occurring throughout the states as well.</p>

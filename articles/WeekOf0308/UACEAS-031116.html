                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">The University at Albany has confirmed plans to house their newly announced College of Engineering and Applied Sciences (CEAS) in the Schuyler Building located near the University's downtown campus on Western Avenue.  The building originally served as Albany High School from 1913 to 1974, and was recently purchased by the University at Albany for $2 million in 2013.  The $60 million renovation project, $20 million of which is expected to be sponsored by government funding, is estimated to be ready for first phase occupancy in 2019.  CEAS will encompass 127,000 gross square feet with enough lecture spaces, classrooms, offices, and research facilities for more than 1000 students and 180 faculty members and researchers.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">A new Department of Computer Engineering within CEAS has been established and is currently hiring faculty positions.  Dr. Kim L. Boyer, current chair of the Department of Computer Engineering at the University at Albany, was named dean of CEAS during this interim period until a permanent dean is appointed.  The culmination of CEAS came together on the morning of July 1st in 2015 when the College of Computing and Information (CCI) was renamed the College of Engineering and Applied Science to better represent the "new, broader mission of the College", as stated by Boyer.  This new mission aims to "educate the next generation of engineering and scientific innovators [and] to conduct leading-edge research of societal significance within and across traditional academic disciplines".</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">The College will begin by offering degrees in computer science, informatics, information studies, and computer engineering.  Each of these builds upon the foundation laid by the former College of Computing and Information and the existing computer science and informatics undergraduate programs.  The undergraduate computer engineering program is currently under review by the board of education to be accredited as an engineering program, but courses are still being offered to interested students as electives.  According to Boyer, there is considerable interest in these courses.  Two sections of Intro to Design and Intro to Analysis have already been filled, each with a waiting list.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">Once the board of education approves the curriculum for the computer engineering undergraduate degree program, student enrollment will begin.  This will make it the only engineering program currently being offered by the University at Albany.  Although CEAS exhibits a core foundation centered around computational and informational sciences,  the College plans on expanding its range of disciplines, which would include electrical engineering, bioengineering, environmental engineering, mechanical engineering and systems engineering.  Electrical engineering will be featured in the same department as computer science and engineering, while the mechanical and systems engineering programs will share their own department.</p> 
		<p style="text-align:justify">In addition to undergraduate programs, the college plans to further expand by offering MS and PhD programs within these disciplines and a complement graduate level computer science degree is ready for implementation. A joint degree working in cooperation with the School of Business in financial engineering is in the beginning stages to be offered as an MS only program as well.  The College of Engineering and Applied Sciences is also looking to promote and create partnerships and programs with local K-12 schools, Albany Med, Albany Law School, Albany College of Pharmacy, and Hudson Valley Community College as well as provide a "maker space" for local entrepreneurs to come together and develop new products and ideas.</p>

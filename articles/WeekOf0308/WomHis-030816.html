                <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">March is Women's History month in the United States, among other countries.  Interestingly, Women's History month for our darling northern neighbors in Canada is October, with the highlight of the month dubbed "Persons Day."  I find this nomenclature much more appropriate in the spirit of women's history than "Women's Day." Current evidence and denotation leads to the inevitable conclusion that women are indeed people, and must be treated as such, and so women's rights are of course nothing more than peoples' rights.  Despite this fact being remarkably clear, there appears to remain some confusion about this basic equality of people.</p>	 
	<p style="text-align:justify">Most consternation and debate on this relatively straightforward issue is simply due to incorrect usage of terminology.  I believe that if the terms "peoples' rights" or "human rights/history" were used as opposed to "women's rights/history," it would become blatantly obvious, even to the most dense and bigoted of people, that there is absolutely no logical debate to be had on this issue at all.  The continued use of "women" rather than "people" to describe things likes the "women's movement," "women's advancements," and "women's pride," subversively implies that there remains a political difference between the two.  This applies to cultural and ethnic groups as well.  While the various cultures and histories of different groups are beautiful and important, meriting appreciation and celebration, the members of each group still undeniably belong to the larger human population, and so legally possess the same qualifications, rights, and privileges.  While our differences should, and must, be celebrated and remembered for the sake of art, festivals, entertainment, literature, history, and the humanities, there is no reason to define or label any people of a certain ethnicity or gender as such in any professional, administrative, or legal matter.  I cannot comprehend why we regularly insist on differentiating between groups of people, in speech or legal policy. </p>
    <p style="text-align:justify"> As a society priding itself on high levels of tolerance and acceptance, we still manage to succeed in alienating many people. We still convey a lack of comfort with diversity by incessantly forcing "diversity appreciation" and "diversity awareness" into workshops, programs, media, and especially everyday conflicts.  This often exacerbates already-present societal issues by adding another level of dispute to situations in which it was not originally present.  If we truly were as open-minded and advanced as we'd like to believe we are, there would be no need for such programs because, just as we automatically see people wearing different types of sweaters all as people, we would also instinctively view people of different genders or ethnicities all as just people.  After all, particularly in our contemporary globally-interconnected world, ancestral background usually plays as much a role in one's life as one chooses, rather analogous to changing outfits.  This is why I advocate for leaving people to determine their own heritage and cultural identity rather than enforcing an identity, usually stereotypical, onto them by consistently asking "Where are you from?", "Where's that accent from?", or "Yes, but where were you born?" I think many first and second generation immigrants will agree that this is a rather irksome habit many Americans possess. There are large numbers of people who affiliate themselves with several cultural identities, have lived in several geographic and political locations, and who do not feel comfortable being badgered with such questions, as if reminders that they do not belong.  People are very proud of what they choose to be, and usually love to talk about themselves, so fear not, for they will do so of their own accord, and need little prompting from others.  In the United States, there has been much legal ground won for people belonging to different groups.  However, there still remains progress to be made, especially at an individual and familiar level.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">That being said, there are still many places around the world where women are barely considered people, where they do not have adequate access to education, resources, legal or financial opportunities, and many other fundamental necessities required to confidently live as a free human being. (Remark: "Free" is, in this case, referring to societal and political freedom, not existential liberation, which is not the subject matter here.) In order to further facilitate the progress of people's rights in our country, and help with much-needed progress in others, the fight must be undertaken by the people, for the people, and remembering that we are irrevocably people.  Perhaps we should consider following in our Canadian friends' footsteps and renaming this lovely month of March "Peoples' month" rather than "Women's month." </p>

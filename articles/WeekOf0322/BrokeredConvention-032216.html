                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">After the results from Super Tuesday, former-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney appeared on national television calling Republican front-runner Donald Trump “a phony” and “a fraud.” Because of Trump’s success in the Republican primaries, the GOP establishment plans to stop him through a brokered convention. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Mitt Romney was not the only prominent GOP Republican to denounce a Trump presidency. House Speaker Paul Ryan, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, and even former-Arizona Sen. John McCain have joined in publicly disavowing Trump. Even Republican Presidential candidate and Ohio Gov. John Kasich supports a brokered convention to keep Trump from the nomination. But what does a brokered convention actually mean for the Republican nomination? </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The GOP Establishment hopes Trump will not clinch the remaining delegates he needs to win the nomination. In which case, the first ballot during the Republican National Convention could determine the nomination. Depending what rules the Republican National Committee (RNC) Rules Committee set, Trump could easily win the nomination. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">In the first ballot, every delegate Trump won in the primaries must vote for him. If a Trump delegate tries to back out on the first ballot, the delegate has effectively “resigned” according to RNC Rule 16. The same rule applies for any delegates the other Republican candidates won. The only open delegates are delegates belonging to candidates that have dropped out of the race. There are around 185 open delegates formerly pledged to Fiorina, Huckabee, Paul, Bush, Carson, and Rubio. If Trump can win enough open delegates to gain the majority, he will become the Republican nominee. If not, the convention will hold another vote in which a larger percentage of the delegates can vote for any candidate. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The first ballot poses more challenges. Open delegates are limited in who they can vote for in the first ballot. RNC Rule 40, established at the 2012 convention, mandates that only candidates who have won the majority of delegates from eight states can run at the convention. If Rule 40 is applied, only Trump and Cruz are currently eligible to run. Currently, Kasich does not have enough states to qualify. But applying Rule 40 will bar Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney, two popular alternative candidates, from the Republican nomination. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The GOP Establishment is hard at work to ensure a brokered convention happens. In the past week, Mitt Romney, Sen. Lindsey Graham, and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz. Romney wrote on Facebook that endorsing Cruz would expedite a brokered convention where they can “nominate a Republican.” He claimed “the only way we can reach an open convention is for Senator Cruz to be successful in as many of the remaining nominating elections as possible.” </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">While some in the Republican Party back a brokered convention, others are concerned about how the public would react. “I think you’d have riots. I think you’d have riots.” Trump responded when asked on CNN’s “New Day” about the prospect of a brokered convention. “I’m representing a tremendous many, many millions of people.” A brokered convention could have a negative impact on the image of the Republican Party. With millions of Americans backing Trump, pulling the nomination from him in a brokered convention may be a slight the Republican Party may never recover from. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify"> Trump supporter Scottie Neil Hughes confirmed the notion of rioting if Trump didn’t win the nomination. She explained on CNN’s “The Situation Room” that the purpose of rioting would be to fight “the fact that our establishment Republican Party has gone corrupt and decided to ignore the voice of the people and ignore the process.” She elaborated on the use of the word ‘riot’ stating, “it’s not a riot as in a negative thing like what we’ve seen in the past, it’s the fact that you have a large amount of people that will be very unhappy... they would make sure their voices are heard, that they can’t be ignored.” </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">With 17 more presidential primaries and more than 900 delegates left, Trump could win the majority he needs to circumvent a brokered convention. And with the commanding lead Trump has, Cruz or Kasich will likely not muster enough delegates to win without the brokered convention. The American public may not have a Republican nominee until July. The results of this outcome may impact the Republican Party for years to come. </p>

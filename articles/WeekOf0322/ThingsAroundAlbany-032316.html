                <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">It is easy to feel trapped in a stuffy dorm room, where bordom can set in with nothing to do except dread the impending due date of that next lab report while whittling away hours trying to beat that next level in Candy Crush (or more accurately, binge watch the new season of <i>Daredevil</i> on Netflix). However, there is a gold mine of things to see, do, and eat that await the curious college student that lie just a few bus stops away. This is by no means a comprehensive list, but rather a quick-start guide to exploring the jewels hidden in plain sight within the Albany area.</p>
                <h3>Things to See and Do</h3>
                <br>
                <h4>The New York State Museum</h4>
                <img class="img-responsive" style="width:800px" src="http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2a/73/55/the-new-york-state-museum.jpg" alt="NY State Museum"> <small>New York State Museum SOURCE: Trip Advisor</small>
                <p style="text-align:justify"><br>The New York State Museum on Madison Avenue provides a wonderful display of the natural and cultural history of the state of New York, providing snapshots of nearly every stage of history in the Empire State. Wildlife from the prehistoric to modern era, Native American cultural artifacts and displays, a tribute to 9/11, and even a Sesame Street segment are a few of the exhibits held within the walls of this museum. So wander around for an hour or two with some friends. The best part is that admission is donation based.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>The Albany Institute of History and Art</h4>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="http://www.albanyinstitute.org/tl_files/photos/assorted/building%20exterior%20summer.jpg" alt="Albany Institute of History and Art"> <small>Albany Institute of History and Art SOURCE: albanyinstitute.org</small>
                <p style="text-align:justify"><br>For those that appreciate art history, the Albany Institute of History and Art on Washington Avenue is a stop worth checking out. It is one of the oldest museums in the United States and offers paintings, statues, artifacts, and even a mummy on display. There is something to be found here for art history buffs and casual visitors alike.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>The Hudson River Coffeehouse</h4>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jEDXJZPip-4/VskqXgrqq7I/AAAAAAAABnA/g6gAt7hHYyg/s1600/IMG_6563.JPG" alt="Hudson River Coffee"> <small>The Hudson River Coffeehouse SOURCE: newyorkcoffeegirl.com </small>
                <p style="text-align:justify"><br>Every Thursday at 8pm, the Hudson River Coffeehouse on Quail street hosts an open mic night that anyone can attend or take part in. Talented musicians, singers, songwriters, comedians, poets, and more from all over Albany gather to put their talents on the stage and most of them don’t disappoint. There’s something about being in that dimly lit atmosphere mixed with the soothing aroma of freshly ground coffee beans while being surrounded by raw talent live on that stage that provides the perfect culmination of a chill Thursday night.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>The Madison Theater</h4>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="http://media.bizj.us/view/img/1002711/madisontheater*750.jpg" alt="Madison Theater"> <small>The Madison Theater SOURCE: The Business Journal</small>
                <p style="text-align:justify"><br>The Madison Theater offers $5 showings of both old and new movies as well as special events such as live music and performances as well as some of the best popcorn in the Capital Region. The scant choice of movies available is greatly outweighed by the price, which is more than half that of what you would pay at the Crossgates or Colonie malls. Tight for cash but still want to watch a movie with some friends? Stop by the Madison Theater.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Things to Eat</h3>
                <br>
                <h4>Cider Belly Donuts</h4>
                <img class="img-responsive" style="width:800px" src="http://www.albany.com/whatsnew/donuts.jpg" alt="Cider Belly Donuts"> <small> Cider Belly Donuts SOURCE: Albany.com</small>
                <p style="text-align:justify"><br>A must-go place of downtown Albany would have to be Cider Belly Donuts. Their wide selection of specialty donuts are to die for. Every variety of donut is offered, ranging from the traditional cider donut to their mocha flavored donut. All of their donuts are made fresh in-house, and lucky customers can even get one hot out of the oven. Occassionally, they offer a special deal of $1 for a bag of ugly donuts that didn’t quite come out as intended, but nonetheless still taste as heavenly as they were meant to be.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Tanpopo Ramen and Sake Bar</h4>
                <img class="img-responsive" style="width:800px" src="http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/65/e7/73/photo1jpg.jpg" alt="Tanpopo Ramen and Sake Bar"> <small>Tanpopo Ramen and Sake Bar SOURCE: Trip Advisor</small>
                <p style="text-align:justify"><br>For those who want to explore what real ramen tastes like, a journey down to Tanpopo Ramen and Sake Bar is a must. Experience how ramen was meant to be enjoyed- not from a cheap $0.17 bag of carbs. Although this one is a little harder to get to by bus (take the 12 bus downtown and then transfer to the 22), the experience is well worth it to open your eyes to a new world of ramen that doesn’t include “chicken flavored”  top ramen.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Peaches Caf&eacute;</h4>
                <img class="img-responsive" style="width:800px" src="http://www.stuyvesantplaza.com/images/Gallery/PEACHE~1.JPG " alt="Peaches Cafe"> <small>Peaches Caf&eacute; SOURCE: stuyvesantplaza.com</small>
                <p style="text-align:justify"><br>Not all places worth going are downtown. Peaches Caf&eacute; lies a brief 15 minute walk from CNSE down Fuller Road in Stuyvesant plaza. Peaches is a great place to grab a delicious desert (I recommend the peach tart) and a hot coffee beverage and relax with some friends. They provide a decent breakfast menu for those seeking more savory options. Their cappuccinos are delicious and there are a plethora of desserts to choose from (all on display when first walking through the doors).</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Professor Java's Coffee Sanctuary</h4>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="http://professorjavas.com/Java%20Pics%202010/Javas%20summer%202008.jpg" alt="Professor Java's"> <small>Professor Java's Coffee Sanctuary SOURCE: professorjavas.com</small>
                <p style="text-align:justify"><br>Another great coffee shop worth visiting is Professor Java’s Coffee Sanctuary, which can be reached by taking the 190 or the 117 bus north down Wolf Road. This is a great lunch hangout spot to go to with friends. Their specialty drinks are delicious and come in cute little mason jars, and their extensive drink menu guarantees that there is a drink to suit anyone's tastes. </p>
                <br>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Listed here is only a snapshot of what to do outside the doors of the dorm room in the Albany area, and all of which are easily reached by bus or a quick walk down to Stuyvesant Plaza. In no way is there enough space to be able to include all of the hidden gems that lie in wait for the curious (and hungry) college student to discover, but this list should give a glimpse of what Albany has to offer.</p>

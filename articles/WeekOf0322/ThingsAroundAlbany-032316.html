                <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">It’s easy to feel trapped in a stuffy dorm room, bored out of your mind with nothing to do except dread the impending due date on that next lab report while you whittle away your hours trying to beat that next level in Candy Crush (or more accurately, binge watch the new season of <i>Daredevil</i> on Netflix). However, there is a gold mine of things to see, do, and eat that await the curious college student that lie just a few bus stops away. This is by no means a comprehensive list, but rather a quick-start guide to send you on your way to explore the jewels hidden in plain sight within the Albany area.</p>
                <h5>Things to See and Do</h5>
                <img class="img-responsive" style="width:800px" src="http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2a/73/55/the-new-york-state-museum.jpg" alt="NY State Museum"> <small>New York State Museum SOURCE: Trip Advisor</small>
                <p style="text-align:justify"><br>The New York State Museum on Madison Avenue provides a wonderful display of the natural and cultural history of the state of New York, providing snapshots of nearly every stage of history of the Empire State. Exhibits range from wildlife from the prehistoric to modern era, Native American cultural artifacts and displays, a tribute to 9/11, and even a Sesame Street segment, just to name a few. You can easily wander around for an hour or two with some friends, and the best part is admission is donation based (so free, if you don’t have a dollar to spare or a conscience to help keep the museum up and running. Your call).<br></p>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="http://www.albanyinstitute.org/tl_files/photos/assorted/building%20exterior%20summer.jpg" alt="Albany Institute of History and Art"> <small>Albany Institute of History and Art SOURCE: albanyinstitute.org</small>
                <p style="text-align:justify"><br>For those that appreciate art history, the Albany Institute of History and Art on Washington Avenue is a stop worth checking out. It is one of the oldest museums in the United States and offers paintings, statues, artifacts, and even a mummy for your viewing pleasure. There is something to be found here for art history buffs and casual visitors alike.<br></p>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jEDXJZPip-4/VskqXgrqq7I/AAAAAAAABnA/g6gAt7hHYyg/s1600/IMG_6563.JPG" alt="Hudson River Coffee"> <small>The Hudson River Coffeehouse SOURCE: newyorkcoffeegirl.com </small>
                <p style="text-align:justify"><br>Every Thursday at 8pm, the Hudson River Coffeehouse on Quail street hosts an open mic night that anyone and everyone can attend or take part in. Talented musicians, singers, songwriters, comedians, poets, and more from all over Albany gather to put their talents on the stage and (most of them) don’t disappoint. There’s something about being in that dimly lit atmosphere mixed with the soothing aroma of freshly ground coffee beans while being surrounded by raw talent live on that stage that provide the perfect culmination of a chill Thursday night.<br></p>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="http://media.bizj.us/view/img/1002711/madisontheater*750.jpg" alt="Madison Theater"> <small>The Madison Theater SOURCE: The Business Journal</small>
                <p style="text-align:justify"><br>The Madison Theater offers $5 showings of both old and new movies as well as special events such as live music and performances as well as some of the best popcorn that you can get in the capital region. The scant choice of movies available is greatly outweighed by the price, which is more than half that of what you would pay at the Crossgates or Colonie malls. If you’re tight for cash but still want to watch a movie with some friends, stop by the Madison Theater to get your fix.<br></p>
                <h5>Things to Eat</h5>
                <img class="img-responsive" style="width:800px" src="http://www.albany.com/whatsnew/donuts.jpg" alt="Cider Belly Donuts"> <small> Cider Belly Donuts SOURCE: Albany.com</small>
                <p style="text-align:justify"><br>A must-go place of downtown Albany would have to be Cider Belly Donuts. Their wide selection of specialty donuts are to die for. Every variety of donut offered, ranging from the traditional cider donut to their mocha flavored donut were far greater than any donut I’ve had. All of their donuts are made fresh in-house, and if you are lucky, you can get one hot out of the oven. Sometimes they offer a special deal of $1 for a bag of ugly donuts that didn’t quite come out as intended, but nonetheless still taste as heavenly as they were meant to be. <br></p>
                <img class="img-responsive" style="width:800px" src="http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/65/e7/73/photo1jpg.jpg" alt="Tanpopo Ramen and Sake Bar"> <small>Tanpopo Ramen and Sake Bar SOURCE: Trip Advisor</small>
                <p style="text-align:justify"><br>For those who want to explore what real ramen tastes like, a journey down to Tanpopo Ramen and Sake Bar is a must. Here you will experience how ramen was meant to be enjoyed- not from a cheap $0.17 bag of carbs. Although this one is a little harder to get to by bus (you have to take the 12 bus downtown and then transfer to the 22), the experience is well worth it to open your eyes to a new world of ramen that doesn’t include “chicken flavored”  top ramen. <br></p>
                <img class="img-responsive" style="width:800px" src="http://www.stuyvesantplaza.com/images/Gallery/PEACHE~1.JPG " alt="Peaches Cafe"> <small>Peaches Caf&eacute; SOURCE: stuyvesantplaza.com</small>
                <p style="text-align:justify"><br>Not all places worth going are downtown. Peaches Caf&eacute; lies just a 15 minute walk from CNSE down Fuller Road in Stuyvesant plaza. Peaches is a great place to grab a delicious desert (I recommend the peach tart) and a hot coffee beverage and just relax with some friends. Their breakfast menu is also pretty decent if you are more inclined to savory foods. Their cappuccinos are delicious and there are a plethora of desserts to choose from (all on display when you first walk through the doors).<br></p>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="http://professorjavas.com/Java%20Pics%202010/Javas%20summer%202008.jpg" alt="Professor Java's"> <small>Professor Java's Coffee Sanctuary SOURCE: professorjavas.com</small>
                <p style="text-align:justify"><br>Another great coffee shop worth visiting is Professor Java’s Coffee Sanctuary, which can be reached by taking the 190 or the 117 bus north down Wolf Road. This is a great lunch hangout spot to go to with friends. Their specialty drinks are delicious and come in cute little mason jars, and it is practically guaranteed that you will find something suiting your taste buds on their extensive drink menu. </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">Listed here is only a snapshot of what to do outside the doors of the dorm room in the Albany area, and all of which are easily reached by bus or a quick walk down to Stuyvesant Plaza. In no way is there enough space to be able to include all of the hidden gems that lie in wait for the curious (and hungry) college student to discover, but this list should give a glimpse of what Albany has to offer.</p>

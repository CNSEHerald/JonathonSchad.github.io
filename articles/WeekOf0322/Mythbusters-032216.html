                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">After 14 years, more than 270 episodes, and over 1,000 myths tested, it is time to say thanks and farewell to our favorite series on Discovery Channel: Mythbusters. The grand finale of the series, featuring the dynamic duo of Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, aired on March 5.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify"><b>“Who are the Mythbusters?”</b> Anyone familiar with the series can recall this phrase kicking off every episode. With his distinctive tones, narrator Robert Lee introduces the mustached and bespectacled characters who brought the show to life. Adam and Jamie, special effects experts, were there from the beginning. Each with their own sense of humor and wit, they put on a show to enrich the lives of all ages. In a relationship comparable to a sibling rivalry, they worked together by sometimes competing against each other, demonstrating that friendly competition can be beneficial to all. Adam’s puppy-like enthusiasm was infectious, encouraging kids and adults alike to become excited about science. Jamie’s levelheaded wisdom and cheesy one-liners added a sense of endearing intellect to the atmosphere of the show.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Working in tandem with the main men, “The Build Team,” was comprised of (in most episodes) Kari Byron, Tory Belleci, and Grant Imahara- an artist, a builder, and one who can best be described as a robotics nerd, who worked together to give us twice the number of myths to bust. They showed us how people of all backgrounds can get involved in scientific adventures. Their skilled cooperation to test their myths was an example of how a team can work like a well-oiled machine to accomplish its goals. As the show alternated between them and the two original Mythbusters, The Build Team brought the show to a whole new level of suspense and excitement.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">And let’s not forget Buster, the poor crash test dummy. Buster was always willing to do what was necessary (and often unnecessary) in the name of science. He showed a level of trust in his coworkers that most of us can only dream of having. It may have gotten him scorched, maimed, dismembered, or killed (many times); but he was always there with an air of dignity and persistence to help find the answers we all sought. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify"><b>“They don’t just tell the myths, they put them to the test.”</b> Idioms, adages, tall tales, superstitions, and legends— the determination of whether these stories were fact or fiction focus of the series. The science of (dis)proving them was real, and so was the fun. The Mythbusters displayed scientific ability in duplicating the circumstances of a myth, while monitoring the potential variables. If one set-up didn’t work, they unabashedly tried another and another if necessary. They then reported unbiased results: myth confirmed, plausible, or busted. But the science, and the fun, didn’t stop there. If a myth was busted, the teams would take it to the next level in an attempt to duplicate the results, often under ridiculous circumstances. And when that wasn’t possible, the Mythbusters accepted defeat with grace and understanding (and occasionally blew stuff up just because they could).</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The Mythbusters were more than mere entertainers; they were teachers. They awakened and fed an interest in science in the hearts of countless individuals of all ages. They showed us what it means to be a team, repeatedly demonstrated how to go above and beyond, and proved that failure is always an option. Unfortunately, the final myth that they seem to have confirmed is that “all good things must come to an end.” Farewell Mythbusters, we will myth you. </p>

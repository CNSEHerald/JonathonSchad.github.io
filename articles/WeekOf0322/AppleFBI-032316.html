                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">The legal battle between Apple and the FBI has faded into the background in recent weeks. However, considering that the Department of Justice has scheduled an evidentiary hearing for Tuesday March 22nd, I believe the topic is still relevant and worth discussing.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The dispute centers around whether or not Apple should create custom software to unlock an iPhone owned by the San Bernardino terrorists. The FBI claims that unlocking it will benefit national security since it would let them know if the shooters were acting alone, or if they had connections to a terrorist organization. It should be noted that Verizon has already turned over the phone records, with no links found. On the other hand, while Apple agrees this could be useful, it argues that this would set a dangerous precedent of invading their customers’ privacy and making their phones vulnerable to hacking. They believe that the FBI can’t force them to create a backdoor, as it would violate their First Amendment rights in which coding can be considered a form of free speech.  To counter, the FBI argues that under the All Writs Act they are allowed to use any means necessary to aid the principles of the law.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">I would like you to view cellphones as a digital home. If the government has a warrant, there are laws in place that provide the context in which they can search your home. I think that these laws should be updated for the 21st century to include our digital homes. For example, the All Writs Act mentioned above is part of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which has failed to see a major update since 1911. Unfortunately, since there are no guidelines in place, many companies in Silicon Valley believe the FBI may abuse the power that comes with this software, just like J. Edgar Hoover did with wire-tapping. The former FBI director was known to use intelligence the bureau gathered to bully critics and fellow government officials. If you’re looking for an example of abuse aside from Hoover, you don’t have to look all the way back to 1789, just 2013. Three years ago, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper lied under oath about the scope of the NSA surveillance program by stating that it did not collect data on millions of Americans. He was forced to recant this statement after leaked documents proved otherwise. Creating and distributing a back door in smartphones would be a poor idea because it could experience similar abuse. Less cynical people, like Apple CEO Tim Cook, believe that these are isolated incidents and that the FBI will always have good intentions. While this may be true, it should be noted that other nations might also feel obliged to a key to this back door. Hypothetically, they could use this to hack our own government agencies, or abuse the rights of their citizens. For these reasons, if a back door were created, companies should not distribute it to government agencies to prevent it from being abused. Also, smartphone manufacturers should not mass-produce operating systems that come with a backdoor, as it is widely accepted that this provides far too great a risk of hacking. </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">However, I believe that a compromise between privacy and security can be reached that includes the creation a backdoor. Companies such as Apple should create a custom operating system to bypass the erasing of data after a certain number of incorrect passcodes have been entered. This enables you to connect the phone to a computer program that opens it through brute force. And by brute force I mean automatically entering countless passwords until the correct one is generated. This software will not be mass-produced or given to anyone outside of the company. When the government comes to them with a warrant, they have the ability to unlock the phone and access the necessary information. With this system in place, government agencies will get the information needed to keep us safe without the threat of our phones being hacked or our rights being infringed upon.</p>

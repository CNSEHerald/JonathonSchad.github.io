                <p class="lead"> "Gonogono guun kata gon gon guun; guun gono guun gono guun kata kata!"			<br>These were the sounds heard emanating from Buchman Pavilion at Russell Sage College in Troy last Thursday night. The college was hosting an "African Drumming Experience" in order to celebrate Black History month, and SUNY Poly students were invited to attend. </p>		<p>The Doundounba performing group began the celebration with a literal "bang." Dressed in colorful African garb, the performers led the spectators through a variety of playing styles, from traditional West African beats to fresh New Guinea tunes. Onlookers soon began to dance and sing along. They then found out that the goat-skin topped drums known as "djembes" that adorned the circular rotunda were there for more than just decoration. The mixture of students and adults representing various visiting universities were invited to gather around and try their hands at the percussion instruments. </p>"It was a life changing experience for me because I got a chance to really experience a culture that is somewhat forgotten in our society, because of all the innovations that we have," freshman Victoria Brenner said. "Yes, the modern society is amazing, but I think it's important to look back at all the other cultures to get a sense of diversity. We actually got to learn about the music that is played, and you get a better sense of the vision of what African culture is and was."</p>		<p>After over an hour of playing, swaying, and in general jamming, the party began to dissipate.  The celebration of Black History month, however, was not yet over. On Saturday students were again invited to experience African culture by visiting the "Black Capital: Harlem in the 20s" exhibit at the New York State Museum.</p>		<p>"I was interested in going because it was something fun to do," freshman David Leff said. "The jazz, sports, and history on famous figures sections were all pretty cool. It was nice to learn some different, interesting facts like how the first woman millionaire was African American. It was a good overview of an interesting part of history, and I would definitely recommend going there."</p>		<p>Countless other events to celebrate Black History month were held in the capital district. From theatre performances and movie screenings to luncheons and fashion shows, African culture was shared and honored. The African Drumming Experience and Harlem museum exhibit were the two to which coordination and transportation were offered by the SUNY Poly Student Activities and Residential Life & Housing. </p>		<p>"I think these events were a good way to get students to go out and learn, and it's important to know what happened in the past," resident advisor junior Zhusupbek Nurdin Uulu said. "We learned a lot about how Harlem was growing in the 1920s and how jazz was born- how people dressed was different. We went in a really nice car and got to get out and see the outskirts of Albany, and even the drive was a learning experience- seeing the architecture on the drive. These events were fun ways to get to learn about history; there is no future without knowing the past. I'd like to see more people come out and participate in these kinds of activities."</p>

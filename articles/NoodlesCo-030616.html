                <p class="lead">A new eatery has opened up over winter break in Crossgate Commons that appears to fill a void that many of us didn't know was there: a one stop shop for all noodles from all over the world. Welcome to Noodles and Co. </p>
		<p>When you first walk in, you are greeted with a modern but still simple interior, reminiscent of trendy fast food chains, but a step up from your average McDonalds. You order at the front and pick your own table, having the workers bring your order to you. It has the relative atmosphere of a fast food chain, but the feel of a simple sit down restaurant.</p>		<p>The variety of the menu is where Noodles and Co. shines. They pretty much have it all, from Japanese pan fried noodles to Wisconsin Mac and Cheese as well as medley of Italian dishes. They even offer non-noodle appetizers. I ventured out and ordered the Korean meatballs, which were marinated in a Korean style spicy barbeque sauce and seasoning. The meshing of the ethnic spices of Korean cuisine and the familiarity of the meatball was interesting and quite delicious.</p>		<p>As for the food itself, it is by no means on the same level as traditional sit down restaurants that specialize in a certain style of food, but is also pretty decent for the price you pay. Due to the fact that it offers so many different types of noodles, you have a "jack of all trades, but master of none" situation. However, for what they do offer, they deliver- although not as well as a Thai restaurant or even Olive Garden, but enough to satisfy a hungry college student who only has seven dollars and an eight minute bus ride to spare.</p>		<p>I ended up ordering the Thai hot pot dish, which was their recommended item on the menu. I've had my fair share of hot pot in the past, and I was curious how their rendition would match up to my experiences. Their version was a valiant effort, given the price I had paid ($8.99) and the time it took to get to me (5 minutes). Although they claimed it to be "hot pot", it would probably be better off being called curry noodle soup. The curry base was surprisingly flavorful, but the noodles used didn't feel like the appropriate kind for the dish, but the combination oddly worked.</p>		<p>You get what you pay for, but the variety and price more than make up for the fast-food like quality of the dishes. I would recommend this establishment to anyone who is sick of the boring, predictable fast food places in the area and want some more variety for their dollar. I personally look forward to revisiting Noodles and Co. to sample more of their dishes that they have available, and it's a good thing that there are many to choose from.</p>

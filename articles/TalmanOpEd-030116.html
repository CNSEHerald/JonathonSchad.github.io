                <p class="lead">So you just got accepted to graduate school. Congratulations! Take a deep breath and relax- you earned it. You'll tell yourself to go on a vacation after you finish undergrad, and you should, because you don't get another chance for a long time.</p>

		<p>Back from vacation? Good, because now you will to go to class, and that means every class. For your responsible friends from undergrad, this isn't any different, but you had managed to figure out how to get A's and B's without ever showing up to a lecture. Honestly, you realize that you can still get away with that if you want to. But that's not the point; your professor from your first semester core class isn't just your professor anymore. She becomes a potential collaborator, source of funding, mentor, committee member, and friend. You end up in a small, collaborative department and being known as studious (and punctual) becomes extremely important to you.</p>

		<p>Speaking of classes, you hear the timeless proverb that we all live by: <i>Grades don't matter</i>. And in many ways they don't (although you find out that anything below a B is considered failing- yikes) but you soon find that part to be irrelevant. You find that you have more freedom to choose specific courses that fit your interests. Coming from CNSE, you're used to small class sizes and individual attention from (most) professors, but you also find out that you're more interested in your coursework than ever before. Homework will be less frequent, but more intellectually challenging and relevant, with emphasis on "challenging." In your first class of the first semester, your professor asks everyone to raise their hands if they have never used MATLAB. You're the only one who raises their hand, and you look around the room and feel the pity in the faces around you. Every morning on the bus, you watch MATLAB tutorials on YouTube, and listen to them like podcasts when you drive. You will go over your cellular data plan each month. At the end of the semester, you're required to implement an algorithm in MATLAB that can automatically parse fluorescent images and count cells, then differentiate them based on morphology. This semester, you use your code to speed up your data analysis in lab almost every week. </p>

		<p>You start doing more work on your assignments, even after they are finished. You learn to enjoy it in a strange, almost masochistic way. Research takes up every moment you're not in class or doing homework. You dive into it- your desk becomes a mess of papers highlighted in yellow, green, and blue. You have a conversation about your research with the woman cutting your hair and you don't even realize that she can't understand what you're talking about. This starts happening everywhere, until you just start saying "I'm in med school" to the people you meet. You feel <i>academic</i>, for the first time.</p>

		<p>But it's not always easy. There are nights when you're awake at 3AM, working on a problem set while also performing data analysis on some histology images (but the undergrad didn't process the images correctly and you have to re-do them by hand, all 150 of them) and that textbook chapter your PI asked you to help write was due two weeks ago, and you look at Facebook and see how happy (and rich) your CNSE friends are that went into industry instead of making the sacrifices that you make. And you make sacrifices- research is time-consuming, especially if you prefer wet lab work. And you'll be lonely sometimes. You won't have the time to adopt that shelter dog you keep looking at on the SPCA website, and you won't be as close with your roommates as you used to be (you're both adults with jobs now!) and when you decide it's time to move out and get your own place, you end up living alone in a new city and all of the social events you had access to during your undergrad career are replaced with "department happy hour" featuring the same 25 people you will see every day for a long time. Your parents stop claiming you as a dependent on their taxes, and you learn what it feels like to be poor. Your contract specifies no part-time jobs, not that you have the time for them anyway. You calculate how much you <i>actually</i> make per hour, and consider sending your CV to McDonald's for the pay raise. After trying to figure out whether you want to buy groceries or replace your car's broken solenoid, you look into the rules for food stamps.</p>

		<p>But you don't do this because you want to be rich. You don't do this because your friends are doing it, or because your advisor told you to, or because you think it'll help you get a date. You do this because you wake up (after getting four hours of sleep) and hand in your problem set, finish your experiments, hit the gym, and finally get to relax in your apartment with a beer and Netflix and your incredibly supportive significant other and you can't help but smile, partly because six months ago you didn't know what the word "histology" even meant, but mostly because you couldn't imagine yourself doing anything else but grad school. </p>

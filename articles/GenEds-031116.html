                <p class="lead">It's almost that time of year again.  Time to sign up for classes.  A time when SUNY Poly students scramble to determine what classes they still need to take, what electives SUNY Poly will offer next semester, and what general education requirements they can cram into their already cramped schedules. </p>
		<p>Now, general education courses, more coloquilly known as gen-eds, are normally met with disdain.  People hate them.  Whether it's that they don't like the material, the professor, the other students in the class, the work they have to do.  You name it and it'll make a student hate the class.  But perhaps it's time to look at gen-eds with a fresh perspective.  Half the battle is the attitude, is it not?</p>
		<p><b>There are such things as fun gen-eds.</b></p>
		<p>Sure, a class on art history isn't going to be the most exciting class or the most rewarding since it's typically filled with freshman or anyone trying to achieve both their art and history gen-ed requirements.  But there are other classes UAlbany and SUNY Poly offer that can fulfill those requirements and offer you a rewarding educational experience because, quite frankly, gen-eds are important.  They expose us to subjects we as scientists and engineers don't typically involve ourselves in and make us more well-rounded individuals.  Some gen-eds require you to write and, although you may not like it, we all need the practice.  And finally, they offer a 55 or 80 minute block of time out of your day that doesn't have to be about deriving the Bloch wavefunction, the velocity profile of a liquid traveling through a pipe, or a particle in a box.</p>
		<p>You just need to know where and how to look.</p>
		<p>The best classes you can take for a gen-ed class are anything topical.  Those are the classes that professors, or even graduate students, really want to teach.  These are classes that are typically labeled as "Topics in [insert subject here]." You'll get some interesting subjects to learn about, and most are highly specific that move beyond the age old American History.  But you must be vigilant.  The same topical classes aren't typically offered every year.  You might miss out on a subject that you would actually like to learn about otherwise.</p>
		<p>Here are some of the topical electives UAlbany offers for next semester:</p>
		<ul style="list-style-type:none">
			<li>AHIS 288 Topics in European History - History of Europe in 17th & 18th Century</li>
			<li>AHIS 290 Topics in American History - History of Marriage & Family in the US</li>
			<li>AENG 226 Focus on Lit Theme, Form, or Mode - Masterpieces of 20th Century Russian Literature</li>
			<li>RPOS 204Y Selected Problems in Political Science - Lobbyists and Special Interests, New York State</li>
			<li>ASOC 299 Special Topic in Sociology - Sociology of Sports</li>
		</ul>
		<p>And the list goes on.</p>
		<p>To save you from eternal boredom in a generic gen-ed class, a 200-level class is the way to go.  It might seem intimidating sitting in class filled with people who major in that subject, but it's not so bad.  If the subject is interesting to you, the subject matter will be just as interesting.  Even if these classes require daily or weekly readings, they're definitely worth the effort because, in the end, wouldn't you rather look upon a class with fondness than with disdain? </p>

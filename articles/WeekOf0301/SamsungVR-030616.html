                <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">The first attempts at virtual reality, or VR, took place during the 1990's, but were a commercial failure. The Nintendo Virtual Boy was released in 1995 and sold less than 400,000 copies. According to game magazine GamePros in 2007, the Virtual Boy is considered one of the top ten least successful consoles of all time. Now a new generation of VR devices is coming into the market, promising to overcome the technological and comfort shortcomings of the past. Is this the start of a new era of entertainment, or a repeat of history?</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">A flood of virtual reality devices are hitting the market this year, with the pre-orders from the Oculus Rift shipping sometime this month, and other devices currently undergoing orders now, such as the HTC Vive for $799 or Facebook's Oculus Rift for $599. Other developers are also throwing their hat into the ring, such as Sony with its PlayStation VR, Samsung's Gear VR and even tech giant Google, with its Google Cardboard. Each system boasts high-end graphics, exclusive games, and a comfortable feel to allow the user to become immersed in their own little virtual world.</p>

		<br><br>
		<p style="text-align:justify">Virtual reality works by having two screens tilted at such an angle as to give 3D effects. The device tracks movement of the head and matches it to the in-game camera. Controllers or other motion control software vary by company, as do compatible games. Many systems use headphones rather than speakers, giving users a comprehensive audio-visual override of reality that helps to immerse them fully into the world. The realistic graphics that are allowed by today's technology give many a feeling that they truly have been transported to another land.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">The technology of virtual reality is touted to have a myriad of uses. Besides a more realistic and improved gameplay experience, there are also calls for its usage as an improved training system for professions such as medical personnel, military, and astronauts. In schools, students could be dropped into historically accurate simulations of the past, gaining a far more memorable experience than can be provided by a book. Artists and designers could create in virtual reality, shaping a design, and running tests and simulations on it, lowering the barrier of entry into certain fields and making it easier to create prototypes. Lastly, VR could be used for those who are bedridden to see more of the world, allowing them to travel the world and see the sights without ever leaving their room.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">However, many claim that the technology is unnerving, that it takes away from the human experience and replaces it with false digital world. This can be clearly seen in the image above, where the audience has their vision blocked by headsets and furthermore are all looking into different directions, allowing Zuckerberg to pass by undetected while they are left helpless. However, this complaint has always been unleashed whenever a new technology enters the market, whether through the popularization of radio in the 1920's, television in the 1950's, or smartphones today. While many claim that people were closer back in the day, a look through history shows that we may not be so different from our ancestors after all.</p>

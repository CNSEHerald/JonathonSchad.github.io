                <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify"> 	Philip Lubin, Professor of Physics at University of California Santa Barbara has published a research paper that is making shockwaves throughout the astronomic community. The proposed system is a laser-based approach that promises to revolutionize the way that we travel through space. </p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">Conventional chemical based rockets rely on the explosive power of massive hydrogen and oxygen thrusters to lift spacecraft out of the Earth's atmosphere. However, this method has proven itself to be very inefficient. Most of the energy produced is spent either as heat or is used to propel the remaining fuel upwards. The rockets themselves were single time use until recently, with SpaceX developing a method of catching the rockets as they fall back to Earth, with mixed success. Despite all of the improvements made in nearly 50 years since we have landed on the moon, the limitations of the technology are clear. Voyager 1 only just left the solar system, and it was launched in 1977. With current technology, it takes six months to travel to Mars, and would take millennia to reach the nearest star systems. If humanity wishes to explore the stars, it cannot rely on rocket fuel to take it there.</p>
 		<p style="text-align:justify">A NASA project, <a href="http://www.deepspace.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/A-Roadmap-to-Interstellar-Flight-15-h.pdf" target="_blank">Directed Propulsion for Interstellar Exploration (DEEP IN)</a> uses photons to push its spacecraft forward. A quantum quirk of photons is that while they have no mass, they have momentum. The idea behind the project is that a series of lasers are collected and focused into a very tight beam that shines onto a highly reflective satellite. The photons bounce off, but impart some of their momentum to the craft. It is analogous to having a toy sailboat in a bathtub, blowing into the sail to move it. In the frictionless environment of space, the continued addition of kinetic energy means that a shuttle could travel at speeds never before attained. In theory, a wafer-sized craft with a one square meter sail could reach 26% of the speed of light within ten minutes.  That is fast enough to reach Mars in half an hour, pass Voyager 1 in three days, and reach the nearest star, Alpha Centauri, in 15 years. An average sized probe weighing 100 kilograms could be accelerated to 2% the speed of light using this technology in that same 10 minutes. For comparison's sake, the highest speed of a spacecraft recorded thus far is Voyager 1, traveling at approximately 0.006% the speed of light. </p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">The technology behind the system is not science fiction, rather is very attainable. The various components, from the thin films used in the optical systems, to the lasers themselves and the hyperfine servos needed to precisely control the angles involved are all in existence. Such a system is also more easily scalable than rocket technology. The bigger the proposed permanent launch platforms, the faster a potential space craft could go, but this also allows for smaller test sites to be built and used. Rather than being all or nothing with its test launches such as a rocket, a permanent laser launch station could be used to send probes and craft far into the reaches of space at a far higher frequency and at a much lower cost, as the cost of the infrastructure would be split between missions.
		<p style="text-align:justify">Currently, photonic propulsion systems are in proof of concept tests, stopping the spin of known nearby asteroids and within vacuum chambers in research facilities. Additional testing is being done to determine the effectiveness of the technique at the astronomical ranges used in the proposal, as data only exists to 100 kilometers, or approximately a third of the thickness of Earth's atmosphere. Nevertheless, further testing strategies have been suggested, such as use of such systems for the defense of the International Space Station from debris, as well as clearing out defunct satellites that are currently orbiting Earth. Photonic Propulsion Systems, if they ever get off the ground, promise to revolutionize how humanity will travel the stars in the near future. </p>

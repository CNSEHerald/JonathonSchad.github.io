                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">With the results of first primary elections including those of Super Tuesday, the list of presidential hopefuls has dropped to a handful of candidates who are leading in the polls. </p>  
		<p style="text-align:justify">Real estate developer and reality television star Donald Trump leads the Republican race with 329 delegates, Texas Senator Ted Cruz comes in second with 231 delegates, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio is in third with 110 delegates.  While in the Democratic race, Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is leading with 1,058 delegates and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is behind with 431 delegates.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">These five presidential candidates have a wide range of positions on the nation's most important issues.  To understand the platforms of these candidates, The Herald has explored the plans and opinions of each candidate on the subjects of the economy, health care, immigration, and education as the candidates give them on their own websites.</p>

		<h3>The Republican Candidates</h3>

		<h4>Donald Trump: "Make America Great Again"</h4>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Economy and Tax Reform:</strong>  In his short clip on the economy, Donald Trump asserts that if elected "everybody's taxes [are] going down, we're going to grow our economy; we have to get rid of the 19 trillion dollars in debt".  He goes on to emphatically state that the nation debt is unfair to the youth of America.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Health Care:</strong> According to Donald Trump's official website, his only comments of topics relating to national health concern the nation's 'drug epidemic'.  On the issue of preventing the sale, use, transportation, and distribution of drugs, Donald Trump stated that he is "going to create borders, no drugs are going to come in".  He goes on to assure that he is also concerned with the rehabilitation of the nation's citizens who struggle with drug addiction and that "we will make them better".</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Immigration:</strong>  The basis of Donald Trump's immigration policy is that "we don't have a country if we don't have borders".  He supports the building of a wall along the United States-Mexico border to prevent illegal immigration, but assures that he supports legal immigration, as Donald Trump said, "we want people to come in and we want to treat people fairly".</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Education:</strong> The center of Donald Trump's education position is the idea that "we cannot have the bureaucrats in Washington telling you how to manage your child's education".   Trump strongly believes that the Common Core is a 'disaster' and that it must not be allowed to continue.</p>

		<h4>Ted Cruz: "Reigniting the Promise of America"</h4>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Economy and Taxes:</strong> Ted Cruz states on his website that his tax plan involves creating one flat tax rate.  He says that the "current seven rates of personal income tax [ranging from 10-39.6%] will collapse to a single low rate of 10%".</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Health Care:</strong> Cruz's plan for the health care has two major components.  First, he is an opponent of abortion and supports "taking away taxpayer dollars from Planned Parenthood".  Second, he is a firm believer that Obamacare must be repealed.
		<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Immigration:</strong> Ted Cruz advocates for increased boarder security, saying that he "will build a wall that works, triple border security, and put in place the surveillance and biometric tracking to secure the border".  Cruz supports legal immigration, but says that he would "halt any increase in legal immigration so long as American unemployment remains unacceptably high".</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Education:</strong> Ted Cruz's only mention to the education system on his website's  Issues page is a part of his plan to reduce the size and power of the federal government by eliminating five departments, including the Department of Education.</p>

		<h4>Marco Rubio: "A New American Century"</h4>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Economy and Taxes:</strong> Rubio plans to reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three.  The range of percent values paid on gross income would go from 10-39.6% to 15%, 25%, and 35%.<p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Healthcare:</strong>  Rubio's health care platform is "repeal Obamacare, replace it with a 21st Century, market driven alternative" by passing "consumer based health care reforms".  This will be an "urgent priority" of the Rubio administration.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Immigration:</strong> Rubio proposes a four billion dollar security upgrade to the United States-Mexico border that will put up camera and sensors. Within the US, he urges enforcing immigrant laws in the workplace and initiating visa tracking systems. Rubio ensures that he is not anti-immigrant.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Education:</strong> On the issue of K-12 education, Rubio's policy is to immediately dissolve the Common Core system.  His website states that "on day one, Marco will issue an Executive Order directing all federal agencies to stop any and all activity related to implementing or encouraging Common Core." On the issue of college education, Rubio advocates a plan to make loan payments proportional to the earning of those with tuition loan debts.
            
        <h4>John Kasich: "A Positive Vision for America"</h4>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Economy and Taxes: </strong>Known on his website as the "Kasich Action Plan," Kasich outlines his plans for economic revival that will create a "climate for job creation." Kaisch hopes to enact policies for balancing the budget within eight years, cutting taxes for families and businesses, reducing federal regulations, removing barriers for increased energy production, and returning major federal responsibilites to state and local governments. </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Healthcare: </strong>Like his collegues, Kasich intends to repeal Obamacare and replace it with "efforts that instead improve access by actually lowering health care costs without interfering with Americans' personal health care decisions or imposing punishing burdens on job creators." His plan to replace Obamacare is focused on patient-centered primary care and episode-based payments.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Immigration: </strong>In a town-hall meeting Kasich held in Derry, N.H. back in August, he indicated his stance on illegal immigration. While Kasich does believes in finishing the wall along the Mexican border, he also believes in amnesty for immigrants already in the country. "If they've been law-abiding, then I think they should stay," Kasich said during the town-hall. Kasich further noted that mass deportation of immigrants was not a viable option. </p>
        <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Education:</strong> Kasich's policy on education revolves around high expectations in math and English and to return the responsibility education standards to the local school districts. According to his website, he believes that states should "develop, adopt and maintain their own rigorous standards, not impose federally mandated learning standards on local schools." He supports making college more affordable "by paying colleges and universities based on helping students complete courses and graduation, not based on enrollment." This system had already been enacted in Ohio.</p>

		<h3>The Democratic Candidates</h3>

		<h4>Hillary Clinton: "America Starts Right Here"</h4>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Economy and Taxes:</strong> According to Hillary Clinton's website, she believes in instituting tax relief for working families to help them manage the cost of living.  She also believes in creating laws to "close corporate tax loopholes [to] make the most fortunate pay their fair share".</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Health Care:</strong> Clinton's health care platform is based on the belief that "affordable health care is a basic human right".  Her website affirms that since 1979 she has passed legislation to expand access to and reduce costs of health care.  Clinton wants to add incentives for states to expand Medicaid.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Immigration:</strong> Hillary Clinton wants to create pathways to citizenship for illegal immigrants, end immigrant detention centers, prevent deportation of parents of Americans and lawful citizens, and institute fee waivers on naturalization.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Education:</strong> Hillary Clinton's plan for K-12 education involves investing in teacher support and pushing to provide opportunities for individual skills and needs for all students.  On the issue of college education, Clinton wants to hold universities accountable for affordable tuition and ensure that students will no longer need to take out loans to get a college education.</p>

		<h4>Bernie Sanders: "A Political Revolution is Coming"</h4>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Economy and Taxes:</strong> Bernie Sanders's website features a thirteen point plan to improve the United States' economy, this plan includes a "progressive state tax on the top 0.3% of Americans who inherit more than $3.5 million", taxing Wall Street speculators, and an increase on the "federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 by 2020".
		<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Health Care:</strong> The Sanders health care plan is built around the idea that "health care must be recognized as a right, not a privilege".  Sanders vows to create a "single-payer national health care program" making Medicare available for all.  Sanders also states that he wants to expand disability rights and decrease the cost of prescription medicine.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Immigration:</strong> Sanders wants to increase border security with the use of cameras, thermal imaging, and motion sensors.  He also wants to "allow immigrants to purchase health coverage under the Affordable Care Act", "return…unjustly deported immigrants and unite broken families", and "create a reasonable and fair wait for citizenship".</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Education:</strong> Sanders advocated for "joining Germany, Chile, Norway, Sweden, and other developed countries" in implementing free college education. Sanders plans to pay for this by implementing a tax on Wall Street speculators. Additionally, Sanders wants to cut student loan interest rates from 4.29% to 2.37%.</p>

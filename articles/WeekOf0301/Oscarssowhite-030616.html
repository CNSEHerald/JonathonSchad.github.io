                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">Many notable happenings took place during last Sunday's 88th Academy Awards celebration: <i>Spotlight</i> won best picture, Lady Gaga absolutely killed it in one of the most powerful performances in recent history, and Leonardo DiCaprio finally found that elusive Oscar. However, something more important took place that Sunday other than the death of a meme. </p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">This marked the second year in a row where not a single person of color was nominated for any of the 20 acting slots, despite 2015 being host to arguably several "nomination worthy" performances by the likes of Benicio del Toro in <i>Sicario</i>, Will Smith in <i>Concussion</i>, and Idris Elba in <i>Beasts of No Nation</i>. This has stirred up a buzz within the entertainment world, spurring the #OscarsSoWhite trend on social media and causing many members of the film community to boycott the event, including Will Smith, Idris Elba, and director Spike Lee, to name a few. In fact, Lee spoke out regarding this white streak, saying "40 white actors in 2 years and no flava [sic] at all." But it was host Chris Rock's biting and witty monologue that brought the whole situation into perspective, referring tongue-in-cheek to the event as the "White People's Choice Awards".</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">Does the fault of this situation lie in inherent racism within the academy? Not necessarily. Nominations for the categories are carried out by a weighed vote in which all members of the Academy are asked to list their top picks for each category, where choices listed in the number one slot count as more votes than that listed as number 4 and so on. It's possible that many members had listed <i>Straight Outta Compton</i> and <i>Creed</i> on their lists, but not quite high enough to get enough votes for a nomination. To be fair, there were many great films to debut in 2015, and all nominations that were awarded were well deserved. So I wouldn't write off the academy as being blatantly racist on this ground, since it is not completely blind to diversity in film. For instance, just a few years ago, <i>12 Years a Slave</i> took home the Oscar for Best Picture while lead actress Lupita Nyong'o received the Best Actress Award. </p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">So then why is this happening for the second time in a row? The problem at hand doesn't lie within the Academy and the Oscars themselves, but rather the larger issue is the lack of diversity in this white-washed industry as a whole.  Going back to Chris Rock's monologue, racism is present in Hollywood, but not necessarily of the kind we are used to. He goes on to say that "Hollywood is sorority racist. It's like, 'We like you Rhonda, but you're not a Kappa'". Although this bit garnered many laughs from the audience, there is no denying the haunting reality that speaks true from these words. Actors of color simply are not given the same opportunity that their white colleagues are provided with. </p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">There is also an alarming number of instances where white actors were cast to play roles that by all accounts should have gone to non-white actors. Take for instance the recent blockbuster <i>Exodus: Gods and Kings</i> in which Christian Bale takes the lead as Moses, who historically, is Egyptian, and not a white man from Wales. However, when the tables are turned and someone of color plays a role that society has deemed as "white", everyone loses their cool. For example, people were up in arms on Twitter after a black Hermione was cast in the newest play <i>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</i>. In the recent summer movie <i>Fantastic Four</i>, Michael B. Jordon was cast as the Human Torch, a role previously filled by Chris Evans. In both of these cases many people cried out that these castings were "not true to the character"; however, when you have someone like Jake Gyllenhaal play the title role in <i>The Prince of Persia</i>, no one bats an eye. </p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">Now let's take a look at the Great White Way of Broadway where, ironically, a not so white show is currently dominating. Yes, I am talking about <i>Hamilton</i>, and more people should be. The genius behind the musical, Lin-Manuel Miranda, tells the story of Alexander Hamilton, a traditionally historic white man, with a largely non-white cast in such a way that blends a medley of sounds and innovation to tell the story of America by Americans.  The success of <i>Hamilton</i> is not something that can be ignored. After their recent performance at the Grammy's, they sold out tickets until January 2017. Maybe Hollywood should take note of <i>Hamilton</i>'s success and not be afraid to take risks to deviate from the "safe" white washed ways. It's sad to say, but even though it's 2016, racism (whether subconscious or blatant) is still a thing, and it really shouldn't be, but at least some strides are being taken to include diversity in the art medium.</p>

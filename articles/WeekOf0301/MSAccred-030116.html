                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify"> From Sunday, February 21st until Tuesday, February 23rd, faculty and students met with the Middle States Commission for Higher Education Committee to gain re-accreditation status for SUNY Polytechnic Institute. This culminated into the reading of a draft of the committee's review of the Albany campus at 9AM on Wednesday, February 24th in the NFS Auditorium.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">The Middle States Commission for Higher Education (MSCHE) reviews colleges and universities in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This regional accreditation entity evaluates entire institutions on a set of fourteen standards devised to evaluate the institution's quality of education and student life. These standards fall into two broad categories: institutional context and educational effectiveness. Review of each standard with respect to the university's mission and goals results in accreditation, probation, or failure.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Accreditation is an important tool used by professional and graduate entities to evaluate an institution's education. According to the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA), accreditation serves as a means for ensuring the quality of the institution's education program. In some cases, argues the CHEA, accreditation is utilized as a prerequisite for employment. Both the Utica and Albany sites underwent a separate accreditation review by the MSCHE committee.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">Early 9AM on Wednesday, February 24th, the President of the MSCHE, Dr. John Anderson, read the exit report drafted by the committee members after conducting 3 days of review. The committee sent to review SUNY Poly consists of deans and professors from other universities in the northeast. According to the Vice-President of the Undergraduate Student Association, Jeff Richards, "a Dean from the New York Institute of Technology, professors from some schools in Pennsylvania and Vermont comprised the MSCHE committee reviewing SUNY Poly."</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">This meeting, although open to all students, faculty, and staff, was comprised primarily of SUNY Poly faculty and administration. This may be due to the lack of advertising to students about the important Middle States decision. After praising SUNY Poly for having an impressive mission and vision and stating that the visit was well organized, Anderson read the evaluation of SUNY Poly's ability to meet each of the fourteen standards. Within each standard Anderson issued non-binding suggestions and binding recommendations.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">The draft concluded that CNSE appeared to meet all of the standards set forth by the MSCHE. Below is a summary of all fourteen standards and recommendations issued by the committee.</p>

		</ul>
		<br>
		<p style="text-align:justify">Concerns were made regarding the percentage of adjunct faculty within some general education departments, the committee cited that some departments have 100% adjunct faculty. Additionally, non-binding suggestions were made regarding student facilities at CNSE including items like offering library services and including a dining hall in the new residential hall plan.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">While the quality of the education and SUNY Poly's assessment strategies were given an in-depth assessment and some rather minor recommendations, the presence of student facilities was left as a suggestion. The MSCHE committee suggested that facilities be built quickly, noting that current students seemed dissatisfied. The term seemed dissatisfied would come as a shock to students who spoke directly with the MSCHE committee.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">On Tuesday, February 23rd, the MSCHE committee met with the vice-president of the Graduate Student Association, the president of the Utica site's UGSA, the vice-president of the Albany site's UGSA, and other graduate and undergraduate students for a luncheon and meeting. According to Richards, an attendee of the meeting, the members of the committee asked the students questions about how they felt about SUNY Poly in terms of "academia, student involvement, [and] student life."</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">While Richards says that students praised the quality of the faculty, he mentioned on multiple occasions that the students felt as though they were being treated like "second-class citizens." This was with regard to the student's opinion that the facilities promised by SUNY Poly were not being built fast enough. Richards also noted that the students from the Albany site voiced their concern to the MSCHE committee that "[the school doesn't] even have the basic necessities of college life." The representatives from the Utica site agreed with the students from the Albany site, according to Richards, and they thought "the students [were] a marginalized community... [that weren't] treated with the respect they deserved."</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">The final decision will not be made for another month or so, but MSCHE accreditation is looking promising for SUNY Poly's Albany campus. More information on the accreditation standards put out by the MSCHE can be found on <a href="http://www.msche.org/?Nav1=POLICIES&Nav2=INDEX">their website</a>. </p>

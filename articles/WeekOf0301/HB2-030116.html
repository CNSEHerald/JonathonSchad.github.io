                <p class="lead" style="text-align:justify">The sudden passing of Antonin Scalia, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, on February 13, 2016, will have major effects on the court ruling of several important issues this year, including immigration and health care reform and most imminently, abortion law. </p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">In 2013, the Texas Legislature passed a bill called House Bill 2, or HB 2, which placed several restrictions on abortion clinics.  This bill mandates that: </p>
		<blockquote style="text-align:justify"> A physician performing or inducing an abortion must, on the date the abortion is performed or induced, have active admitting privileges at a hospital that is located not further than 30 miles from the location at which the abortion is performed or induced and provides obstetrical or gynecological health care services. </blockquote>
		<p style="text-align:justify">According to Fund Texas Choice, prior to the enactment of HB 2, there were 36 abortion clinics in the state of Texas, there are currently ten, leaving several areas in Texas over 200 miles from the nearest clinic.  The BBC stated that opponents to the law claim that HB 2 makes operation costs prohibitively expensive for abortion clinics to operate and puts an 'undue burden' on a woman’s right to an abortion.  Whole Woman’s Health, the group leading the legal challenge against HB 2, must create a separate surgical center that serves fewer people at a higher cost.  "It actually makes absolutely no sense," Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder of WWH, told Bloomberg Politics. She says the new building is "set up assuming that people are going to have surgery, like they’re actually going to be cut open." The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the law is constitutional and the case will be brought before the Supreme Court on March 2, Texas Independence Day.</p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">Before the death of Justice Scalia, the Supreme Court was made up of four liberal justices and five conservative justices.  Since the recent passing of Scalia, whom the Daily Gazette describes as a "kind of champion to the conservative legal world" and "an outspoken opponent of abortion", the Supreme Court is now split evenly between liberals and conservatives.  When HB 2 comes to the floor in the case of Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, a 4-4 tie, according to the BBC and Think Progress, would mean that "the Fifth Circuit’s decision to uphold the Texas’s HB 2 law will stand" and the states of Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi, those within the Fifth Circuit, will gain the ability to further restrict abortion. </p>
		<p style="text-align:justify">The appointment of a ninth justice to the Supreme Court could have a major impact on the ruling of this case and those of affirmative action, healthcare reform, and immigration reform, cases which are set to come before the court in the coming months.  Republicans are currently pushing to postpone the appointment of a replacement for Justice Scalia until after the 2016 election.  According to USA Today, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stated that "The American people‎ should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President."  CNN reported that Senator McConnell also stated that the senate has the right to grant or withhold consent to the president’s nomination, and in this case, he affirms that the senate will withhold it.  Democrats are arguing that the nation cannot go a year with a vacancy in the Supreme Court.  The White House has reported that "the Court’s 4-4 decisions have no value in establishing precedent on which future decisions can rely."  President Obama said that he would "nominate a successor in due time".  CNN reports that a recent Fox News and Pew Research Center polls find that a majority of Americans favor the President and Senate working to fill the vacancy before the 2016 election. </p>

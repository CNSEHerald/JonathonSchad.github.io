   <div class="clearfix colelem" id="u24166-100"><!-- content -->
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-2">To many younger SUNY Poly students, Dr. Susan Sharfstein is the Chemistry professor.&nbsp; Teaching introductory chemistry has a way of ‘typecasting’ a professor to younger students.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-3">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-5">As students continue at CNSE, they will see more of Professor Sharfstein.&nbsp; If a student is in the engineering track, they will also have her for ‘Fluid Mechanics and Transport Processes’, an extremely engineering heavy course.&nbsp; Students who take the more biology geared classes will find Professor Sharfstein giving guest lectures on topics ranging from biologic batteries to biomanufacturing.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-6">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-8">So what type of background must Professor Sharfstein have in order to teach chemistry, fluid dynamics, and all manner of biology?</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-9">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-11">“We could be here for hours.”&nbsp; Sharfstein responded.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-12">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-14">I laughed at that – her answer did not surprise me.&nbsp; We were sitting in her office which was covered floor-to-ceiling in decorative items that appeared to come from all over the world.&nbsp; If every item had a story, I had no doubt that her observation was true.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-15">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-17">Professor Sharfstein began her academic career at the California Institute of Technology as a Chemical Engineer.&nbsp; While she was at Caltech, she earned a fellowship for women through the university, which enabled her to spend a summer in the lab of Channing Robertson at Stanford.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-18">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-20">“And that was actually where I became interested and engaged by biotechnology and biochemical engineering.&nbsp; When I was in High School, biology was not particularly interesting.&nbsp; And really it is that biology changed, it became much less observational and much more of a science.”&nbsp; She elaborated.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-21">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-23">Once her undergraduate education was coming to a close, she began looking into graduate programs.&nbsp; Sharfstein figured that she would continue working in Robertson’s lab and get her PhD from Stanford University.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-24">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-26">Of course, she was not expecting the brother of a friend of her mother to play such an important role in her graduate school decision.&nbsp; At that point, this loosely affiliated man was on the faculty of UC Berkeley.&nbsp; At a party, he told her to contact Doug Clark, who was a new hire within the department.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-27">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-29">There were other schools that were on her potential list at this time.&nbsp; “I applied to Stanford, MIT, Cornell, and Berkeley, and I visited Cornell and MIT and they were fine, but I am a native Californian and the weather is cold.”&nbsp; Sharfstein stated matter-of-factly.&nbsp; As a native New Yorker, I laughed in agreeance.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-30">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-32">She continued, “Honestly the reason I chose Berkeley over Stanford was because,” She added an aside, “You have to remember…this was in the days before email.&nbsp; And so, Doug returned my phone calls and Channing didn’t until it was too late.”</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-33">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-35">Sharfstein entered graduate school with a university fellowship and later picked up the NSF Graduate Fellowship as well.&nbsp; Her thesis regarded metabolism and NMR spectroscopy for the production of recombinant therapeutic proteins.&nbsp; In essence, the research found that metabolism is not as defining in mammalian cells as it is in bacteria. When she graduated she was faced with another big decision: what to do after graduate school?</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-36">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-38">At the time, her husband was still finishing his PhD at the University of California Berkeley.&nbsp; Not wanting to leave, Sharfstein contacted a new faculty member, Jay Keasling, about working for him as a postdoctoral student.&nbsp; He accepted.&nbsp; They had a good working relationship before and, almost more importantly, her fellowship made her cost much less than a graduate student.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-39">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-41">“Working with Jay was great.” She reminisced. “Jay is two years older than I am and… It was really nice to have someone just a little bit ahead of you giving you advice because their perspective is very different than someone who is a little more senior.”&nbsp; Much of that advice pertained to academia.&nbsp; Sharfstein had always known she wanted to be a professor.&nbsp; She went on to explain how they discussed methods of managing research groups and how to be a mentor.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-42">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-44">While she was in Keasling’s lab, Sharfstein applied to and received a transferable NIH grant, which opened the door for her next postdoctoral study at University of California at Los Angeles.&nbsp; This time, she wanted to learn cell and molecular biology techniques and the grant gave her the freedom to pursue that interest.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-45">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-47">After mailing away graduate brochures and writing letters of interest for specific labs, Sharfstein ended up in Harvey Herschman’s laboratory.&nbsp; Research from this lab proved to be a good combination of new biology techniques and imaging that she was comfortable with.&nbsp; She enjoyed that the lab was filled with people of very different backgrounds.&nbsp; UCLA had a medical school which enabled the lab to collaborate with MDs who think about science in a very different way than a PhD does.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-49">During this time, Sharfstein had been interviewing for various faculty positions. Some were interesting, while others did not offer opportunities for both her and her husband, an issue she referred to as the “Two-Body Problem”.&nbsp; Eventually an offer from the University of Toledo came.&nbsp; It was a new and exciting bioengineering department and her husband was subsequently offered a postdoctoral position at University of Michigan, about an hour away.&nbsp; She decided to take the position.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-50">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-52">Overall, she enjoyed her time at the University of Toledo.&nbsp; Sharfstein remarked on how nice the students and faculty were.&nbsp; Unfortunately, after a few years, the bioengineering department was starting to change directions.&nbsp; At the same time, her husband was offered a position in Schenectady, NY and she was four to five months pregnant with their first child.&nbsp; It was decided that a change was in order.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-53">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-55">“My thesis advisor’s close friend, John Dordick, was the department chair in chemical and biological engineering at RPI” Sharfstein commented.&nbsp; She reached out to Dordick about giving a seminar while she and her husband were in the Capital Region, looking at housing.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-56">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-58">&nbsp;“So I go out [to RPI] and give a seminar, and you know, some of the faculty [were] very excited and some of the faculty [were] not so excited. All right. So they don’t really make me a job offer.”&nbsp; She shrugged.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-59">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-61">Though, to most people, a little more than a shrug would be in order.&nbsp; With no job offer from RPI, she was now three weeks away from her due date, and her and her husband had still not made a decision on if they were going to stay in Ohio or move to New York.&nbsp; Eventually they decided to move to the northeast and hope for the best.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-62">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-64">While this was happening, Sharfstein applied for and received a Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education award to work at the Wadsworth center in Albany.&nbsp; This gave her a year of employment in the New York State Department of Health.&nbsp; At the same time, she applied for and received a NSF CAREER grant, which is the NSF’s most prestigious award that supports junior faculty.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-65">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-67">“Suddenly, I am a much more desirable faculty candidate because I have one of these prestigious awards.”&nbsp; While at the Wadsworth center, Sharfstein began applying for faculty positions at University of Rochester, University of Nebraska, University of Southern California and RPI.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-68">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-70">She was offered positions by University of Nebraska and University of Rochester; however, RPI was still dragging their feet.&nbsp; “Like everything, this world is political.&nbsp; RPI was moving toward the direction of more biotechnology, and that meant I was a great fit for that.&nbsp; However, some of the older non-bio faculty were very threatened by that because they felt like, ‘the institution is going this way and there is not a place for us there’.”</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-71">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-73">Eventually, Sharfstein was offered a position at RPI where she worked for about eight years.&nbsp; During her time there, Sharfstein was the only woman in the department – a fact that did not go unnoticed by her or her colleagues.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-74">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-76">“I had a colleague that was rather loud and vocal… I thought he didn’t like me and I realized, no, he actually liked me as a person.&nbsp; The problem wasn’t that he didn’t like me, the problem was that he didn’t respect me.”&nbsp; She advised, “You want to be liked, but at the end of the day you need to be respected.”</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-77">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-79">When the topic of tenure came up, the faculty, save for the aforementioned professor, all voted in her favor.&nbsp; Additionally, the dean also supported Sharfstein’s tenure which made the Provost’s rejection an extremely political move.&nbsp; Sharfstein decided to leave the institution in search of different research opportunities and, this time, she had an ace up her sleeve.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-80">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-82">During this period, Sharfstein received an incredible bargaining chip: a one million dollar NIH grant.&nbsp; She had been in contact with Scott Tenenbaum, from the newly formed CNSE, after a lecture he gave on biotechnology.&nbsp; After discussing the philosophy and direction of the department, Sharfstein was offered a position at CNSE where she moved her lab and million dollar grant.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-83">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-85">When asked what she liked about CNSE, she spoke very highly of her colleagues and the students.&nbsp; In addition, she valued the opportunity to do some chemical engineering in tandem with her biomanufacturing based projects.&nbsp; Sharfstein is currently on a grant with SEMATECH to investigate energetic materials and explosions in cleanrooms.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-86">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-88">Before our interview was over, I asked if she had any advice to give to young students.&nbsp; She responded with the importance of finding a good mentor, and better yet, a ‘champion’.&nbsp; She defined a champion as someone who is willing to nominate you for positions and do what it takes to advance you professionally.&nbsp; She also stressed the importance of applying for fellowships, and to never be afraid to apply for gender or race specific opportunities – a message that is clear from her narrative.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-89">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-91">Another memorable bit of advice was one that she gave earlier in the interview.&nbsp; “Never turn down a job you haven’t been offered”, which were words given to her by a former advisor.</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-92">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-94">Though it sounds contradictory, she elaborated that people often think “‘So and So wants to talk to me but I don’t want to talk to them’, ‘I’m not interested in working for them’, ‘I don’t want to live there’… Before they have had a conversation, they have already decided that they don’t want to do this.&nbsp; They haven’t offered you the job!&nbsp; You don’t know if you want to do this!”</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-95">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="Article-Body" id="u24166-97">Along that vein, she advises students to “always keep your eyes and ears open for opportunities.”&nbsp; Most jobs are not filled by people submitting resumes.&nbsp; If she had not remembered Tenenbaum’s lecture, she might not have thought about CNSE and University at Albany as a possible institution.</p>
